To alleviate this problem, we present Vertical Learning Paradigm (VLP), which extends embedding models by allowing to explicitly copy target information from related factual triples for more accurate prediction.

12, TITLE: When Does Monolingual Data Help Multilingual Translation: The Role of Domain and Model Scale

19, TITLE: Improving Classifier Robustness Through Active Generation of Pairwise Counterfactuals
AUTHORS: ANANTH BALASHANKAR et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Most existing methods either completely rely on human-annotated labels, an expensive process which limits the scale of counterfactual data, or implicitly assume label invariance, which may mislead the model with incorrect labels. In this paper, we present a novel framework that utilizes counterfactual generative models to generate a large number of diverse counterfactuals by actively sampling from regions of uncertainty, and then automatically label them with a learned pairwise classifier.

20, TITLE: Revisiting Acceptability Judgements

AUTHORS: William Hogan ; Jiacheng Li ; Jingbo Shang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, I.2.7]

25, TITLE: Transfer-Free Data-Efficient Multilingual Slot Labeling
AUTHORS: Evgeniia Razumovskaia ; Ivan Vuli? ; Anna Korhonen
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: To mitigate the inherent data scarcity issue, current research on multilingual ToD assumes that sufficient English-language annotated data are always available for particular tasks and domains, and thus operates in a standard cross-lingual transfer setup. In this work, we depart from this often unrealistic assumption.

26, TITLE: Aligning The Norwegian UD Treebank with Entity and Coreference Information
AUTHORS: Tollef Emil Jørgensen ; Andre Kåsen
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, I.2.7]

AUTHORS: Kailai Yang ; Tianlin Zhang ; Sophia Ananiadou
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.SD, eess.AS]

To address these issues, we propose a VAD-disentangled Variational AutoEncoder (VAD-VAE), which first introduces a target utterance reconstruction task based on Variational Autoencoder, then disentangles three affect representations Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) from the latent space.

45, TITLE: Topic-driven Distant Supervision Framework for Macro-level Discourse Parsing
AUTHORS: Feng Jiang ; Longwang He ; Peifeng Li ; Qiaoming Zhu ; Haizhou Li
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these methods do not take into account the differences between in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, resulting in lower performance and inability to leverage the high-quality in-domain data for further improvement. To address these issues, we propose a distant supervision framework that leverages the relations between topic structure and rhetorical structure.

46, TITLE: Small Language Models Improve Giants By Rewriting Their Outputs
AUTHORS: GIORGOS VERNIKOS et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]

HIGHLIGHT: An abundance of datasets exist for training and evaluating models on the task of summary generation.However, these datasets are often derived heuristically, and lack sufficient annotations to support research into all aspects of summarization, such as evidence extraction and controllable summarization. We introduce a benchmark comprising 8 tasks that require multi-dimensional understanding of summarization, e.g., surfacing evidence for a summary, assessing its correctness, and gauging its relevance to different topics.

56, TITLE: Two Failures of Self-Consistency in The Multi-Step Reasoning of LLMs
AUTHORS: ANGELICA CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

AUTHORS: Wenhao Yu ; Meng Jiang ; Peter Clark ; Ashish Sabharwal
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Although counterfactual reasoning is a fundamental aspect of intelligence, the lack of large-scale counterfactual open-domain question-answering (QA) benchmarks makes it difficult to evaluate and improve models on this ability.

In this paper, we define a new query-focused table summarization task, where text generation models have to perform human-like reasoning and analysis over the given table to generate a tailored summary, and we introduce a new benchmark named QTSumm for this task.

HIGHLIGHT: It remains an open question whether it is feasible to employ mPLMs to measure language similarity, and subsequently use the similarity results to select source languages for boosting cross-lingual transfer. To investigate this, we propose mPLM-Sim, a new language similarity measure that induces the similarities across languages from mPLMs using multi-parallel corpora.

183, TITLE: Instruct-Align: Teaching Novel Languages with to LLMs Through Alignment-based Cross-Lingual Instruction
