169, TITLE: UniCat: Crafting A Stronger Fusion Baseline for Multimodal Re-Identification
AUTHORS: Jennifer Crawford ; Haoli Yin ; Luke McDermott ; Daniel Cummings

We present a nuanced point-of-view that this relaxation can lead to certain modalities failing to fully harness available task-relevant information, and yet, offers a protective veil to noisy modalities, preventing them from overfitting to task-irrelevant data.

187, TITLE: Improving Compositional Generalization Using Iterated Learning and Simplicial Embeddings
AUTHORS: Yi Ren ; Samuel Lavoie ; Mikhail Galkin ; Danica J. Sutherland ; Aaron Courville
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: A line of research in cognitive science has hypothesized a process, ``iterated learning,'' to help explain how human language developed this ability; the theory rests on simultaneous pressures towards compressibility (when an ignorant agent learns from an informed one) and expressivity (when it uses the representation for downstream tasks). Inspired by this process, we propose to improve the compositional generalization of deep networks by using iterated learning on models with simplicial embeddings, which can approximately discretize representations.

As a potential solution to this problem, here we exploit the idea of reducing and rotating the feature space in a lower-dimensional gauge and propose the Gauge-Optimal Approximate Learning (GOAL) algorithm, which provides an analytically tractable joint solution to the dimension reduction, feature segmentation and classification problems for small data learning problems.
