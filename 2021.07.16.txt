93, TITLE: Neural Code Summarization: How Far Are We?
AUTHORS: ENSHENG SHI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To achieve a profound understanding of how far we are from solving this problem, in this paper, we conduct a systematic and in-depth analysis of five state-of-the-art neural source code summarization models on three widely used datasets.

94, TITLE: FastSHAP: Real-Time Shapley Value Estimation
AUTHORS: Neil Jethani ; Mukund Sudarshan ; Ian Covert ; Su-In Lee ; Rajesh Ranganath
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce FastSHAP, a method for estimating Shapley values in a single forward pass using a learned explainer model.

95, TITLE: Multi-label Chaining with Imprecise Probabilities
AUTHORS: Yonatan Carlos Carranza Alarcón ; Sébastien Destercke
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present two different strategies to extend the classical multi-label chaining approach to handle imprecise probability estimates.

96, TITLE: VAD-free Streaming Hybrid CTC/Attention ASR for Unsegmented Recording
AUTHORS: Hirofumi Inaguma ; Tatsuya Kawahara
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose novel decoding algorithms to enable streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) on unsegmented long-form recordings without voice activity detection (VAD), based on monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) with an auxiliary connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective.
