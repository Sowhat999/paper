To verify this hypothesis in a comprehensive way, we propose an original evaluation methodology that varies the degree of novelty of novel classes by partitioning the dataset category-wise either randomly, or semantically, i.e. by minimizing the shared semantics between base and novel classes.

71, TITLE: Road Detection Via A Dual-task Network Based on Cross-layer Graph Fusion Modules
AUTHORS: Zican Hu ; Wurui Shi ; Hongkun Liu ; Xueyun Chen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the features in the existing mainstream model frameworks are often similar in the same layer by the single-task training, and the traditional cross-layer fusion ways are too simple to obtain an efficient effect, so more complex fusion ways besides concatenation and addition deserve to be explored. Aiming at the above defects, we propose a dual-task network (DTnet) for road detection and cross-layer graph fusion module (CGM): the DTnet consists of two parallel branches for road area and edge detection, respectively, while enhancing the feature diversity by fusing features between two branches through our designed feature bridge modules (FBM).

78, TITLE: Boosting Modern and Historical Handwritten Text Recognition with Deformable Convolutions
AUTHORS: Silvia Cascianelli ; Marcella Cornia ; Lorenzo Baraldi ; Rita Cucchiara
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Since convolutional kernels are defined on fixed grids and focus on all input pixels independently while moving over the input image, this strategy disregards the fact that handwritten characters can vary in shape, scale, and orientation even within the same document and that the ink pixels are more relevant than the background ones. To cope with these specific HTR difficulties, we propose to adopt deformable convolutions, which can deform depending on the input at hand and better adapt to the geometric variations of the text.
