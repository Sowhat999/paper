94, TITLE: Synthesizing Dysarthric Speech Using Multi-talker TTS for Dysarthric Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: Mohammad Soleymanpour ; Michael T. Johnson ; Rahim Soleymanpour ; Jeffrey Berry
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we aim to improve multi-speaker end-to-end TTS systems to synthesize dysarthric speech for improved training of a dysarthria-specific DNN-HMM ASR.

95, TITLE: Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement On Compressed Video Using Quantised Data of Deep Belief Networks
AUTHORS: Dionne Takudzwa Chasi ; Mkhuseli Ngxande
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we investigate a way of improving the Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement approach.

96, TITLE: Automatic Classification of Neuromuscular Diseases in Children Using Photoacoustic Imaging
AUTHORS: MAJA SCHLERETH et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood.

97, TITLE: Matched Illumination
AUTHORS: Yuteng Zhu ; Graham D. Finlayson
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we provide a novel way of creating the color filtering effect without making a physical filter: we modulate the spectrum of the light source by using a spectrally tunable lighting system to recast the prefiltering effect from a lighting perspective.

98, TITLE: HistoKT: Cross Knowledge Transfer in Computational Pathology
AUTHORS: RYAN ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we take a data-centric approach to the transfer learning problem and examine the existence of generalizable knowledge between histopathological datasets.

99, TITLE: Few-shot Transfer Learning for Holographic Image Reconstruction Using A Recurrent Neural Network
AUTHORS: Luzhe Huang ; Xilin Yang ; Tairan Liu ; Aydogan Ozcan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we demonstrate a few-shot transfer learning method that helps a holographic image reconstruction deep neural network rapidly generalize to new types of samples using small datasets.

100, TITLE: PRNU Based Source Camera Identification for Webcam and Smartphone Videos
AUTHORS: Fernando Martín-Rodríguez ; Fernando Isasi-de-Vicente
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.9]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we focus on video, first on webcam video and afterwards on smartphone video.

101, TITLE: Pan-Tumor CAnine CuTaneous Cancer Histology (CATCH) Dataset
AUTHORS: FRAUKE WILM et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
