HIGHLIGHT: Thus, in this work, we will introduce a novel graph neural network architecture (WGP-NN) employing (weighted) Gaussian processes (GP) to jointly model the temporal evolution of the occurrence probability of events and their time-dependent uncertainty.

85, TITLE: Improving Inference Performance of Machine Learning with The Divide-and-Conquer Principle
AUTHORS: Alex Kogan
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC, I.2.0; D.1.3; D.4.8]
HIGHLIGHT: Many popular machine learning models scale poorly when deployed on CPUs. In this paper we explore the reasons why and propose a simple, yet effective approach based on the well-known Divide-and-Conquer Principle to tackle this problem of great practical importance.

86, TITLE: Switchable Lightweight Anti-symmetric Processing (SLAP) with CNN to Reduce Sample Size and Speed Up Learning -- Application in Gomoku Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Chi-Hang Suen
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To replace data augmentation, this paper proposed a method called SLAP to intensify experience to speed up machine learning and reduce the sample size.

87, TITLE: Progress Measures for Grokking Via Mechanistic Interpretability
AUTHORS: Neel Nanda ; Lawrence Chan ; Tom Liberum ; Jess Smith ; Jacob Steinhardt
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We confirm the algorithm by analyzing the activations and weights and by performing ablations in Fourier space.

88, TITLE: Phase-shifted Adversarial Training
AUTHORS: Yeachan Kim ; Seongyeon Kim ; Ihyeok Seo ; Bonggun Shin
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To learn high-frequency contents efficiently and effectively, we first prove that a universal phenomenon of frequency principle, i.e., \textit{lower frequencies are learned first}, still holds in adversarial training. Based on that, we propose phase-shifted adversarial training (PhaseAT) in which the model learns high-frequency components by shifting these frequencies to the low-frequency range where the fast convergence occurs.

89, TITLE: Local Consistency As A Reduction Between Constraint Satisfaction Problems
AUTHORS: Victor Dalmau ; Jakub Opr?al
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.CC]
HIGHLIGHT: We study the use of local consistency methods as reductions between constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), and promise version thereof, with the aim to classify these reductions in similar way as the algebraic approach classifies gadget reductions between CSPs.

90, TITLE: On Modeling Network Slicing Communication Resources with SARSA Optimization
AUTHORS: Eduardo S. Xavier ; Nazim Agoulmine ; Joberto S. B. Martins
CATEGORY: cs.NI [cs.NI, cs.AI, C.2; F.1.1; I.2]
HIGHLIGHT: The communication slices provide the communications capabilities required to support slice operation, SLA guarantees, and QoS/ QoE application requirements. Therefore, this contribution proposes a networking slicing conceptual model to formulate the optimization problem related to the sharing of communication resources among communication slices.

91, TITLE: Naturalistic Static Program Analysis
AUTHORS: Mohammad Mehdi Pourhashem Kallehbasti ; Mohammad Ghafari
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.CR, cs.SE]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a framework through which developers can define static program analyses in natural language.

92, TITLE: Duoidally Enriched Freyd Categories
AUTHORS: Chris Heunen ; Jesse Sigal
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.LO, D.3.1; F.3.2]
HIGHLIGHT: The traditional setting is recovered as a full coreflective subcategory for a judicious choice of duoidal category. We give several worked examples of this uniform framework, including the parameterised state monad, basic separation semantics for resources, and interesting cases of change of enrichment

93, TITLE: Inferring Needless Write Memory Accesses on Ethereum Bytecode (Extended Version)
AUTHORS: Elvira Albert ; Jesús Correas ; Pablo Gordillo ; Guillermo Román-Díez ; Albert Rubio
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a static analysis, developed at the level of the EVM bytecode generated by \texttt{solc}, that infers write memory accesses that are needless and thus can be safely removed.

94, TITLE: ImMesh: An Immediate LiDAR Localization and Meshing Framework
AUTHORS: JIARONG LIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR(-inertial) odometry and mapping framework to achieve the goal of simultaneous localization and meshing in real-time.

95, TITLE: NOPA: Neurally-guided Online Probabilistic Assistance for Building Socially Intelligent Home Assistants
AUTHORS: Xavier Puig ; Tianmin Shu ; Joshua B. Tenenbaum ; Antonio Torralba
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we study how to build socially intelligent robots to assist people in their homes.

96, TITLE: Self-Attention Amortized Distributional Projection Optimization for Sliced Wasserstein Point-Cloud Reconstruction
AUTHORS: Khai Nguyen ; Dang Nguyen ; Nhat Ho
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To address the issue, we propose to design amortized models based on self-attention architecture.

97, TITLE: Lesion-aware Dynamic Kernel for Polyp Segmentation
AUTHORS: RUIFEI ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it has always been a challenging task due to 1) the diverse shape, size, brightness and other appearance characteristics of polyps, 2) the tiny contrast between concealed polyps and their surrounding regions. To address these problems, we propose a lesion-aware dynamic network (LDNet) for polyp segmentation, which is a traditional u-shape encoder-decoder structure incorporated with a dynamic kernel generation and updating scheme.
