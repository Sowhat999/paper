In this survey, we present an overview of recent advancements of reinforcement learning and bandits, and discuss how they can be effectively employed to solve speech and natural language processing problems with models that are adaptive, interactive and scalable.

8, TITLE: Weakly Supervised Data Augmentation Through Prompting for Dialogue Understanding
AUTHORS: MAXIMILLIAN CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Dialogue understanding tasks often necessitate abundant annotated data to achieve good performance and that presents challenges in low-resource settings. To alleviate this barrier, we explore few-shot data augmentation for dialogue understanding by prompting large pre-trained language models and present a novel approach that iterates on augmentation quality by applying weakly-supervised filters.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML]

10, TITLE: Towards Interpretable Summary Evaluation Via Allocation of Contextual Embeddings to Reference Text Topics
AUTHORS: Ben Schaper ; Christopher Lohse ; Marcell Streile ; Andrea Giovannini ; Richard Osuala
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite extensive recent advances in summary generation models, evaluation of auto-generated summaries still widely relies on single-score systems insufficient for transparent assessment and in-depth qualitative analysis. Towards bridging this gap, we propose the multifaceted interpretable summary evaluation method (MISEM), which is based on allocation of a summary's contextual token embeddings to semantic topics identified in the reference text.

AUTHORS: Alexis Ross ; Matthew E. Peters ; Ana Marasovi?

27, TITLE: IDK-MRC: Unanswerable Questions for Indonesian Machine Reading Comprehension
AUTHORS: Rifki Afina Putri ; Alice Oh
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing Indonesian MRC datasets (Purwarianti et al., 2007; Clark et al., 2020) are still inadequate because of the small size and limited question types, i.e., they only cover answerable questions. To fill this gap, we build a new Indonesian MRC dataset called I(n)don'tKnow- MRC (IDK-MRC) by combining the automatic and manual unanswerable question generation to minimize the cost of manual dataset construction while maintaining the dataset quality.

32, TITLE: Parameter-Efficient Legal Domain Adaptation
AUTHORS: Jonathan Li ; Rohan Bhambhoria ; Xiaodan Zhu
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Unfortunately, parameter-efficient methods perform poorly with small amounts of data, which are common in the legal domain (where data labelling costs are high). To address these challenges, we propose parameter-efficient legal domain adaptation, which uses vast unsupervised legal data from public legal forums to perform legal pre-training.

AUTHORS: YIFAN HOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Meanwhile, knowledge graphs contain facts in an explicit triple format, which require careful and costly curation and are only available in a few high-resource languages, restricting their research and application. To address these issues, we propose to enhance MLLMs with knowledge from multilingual knowledge graphs (MLKGs) so as to tackle language and knowledge graph tasks across many languages, including low-resource ones.

AUTHORS: Max Glockner ; Yufang Hou ; Iryna Gurevych

51, TITLE: Predicting Long-Term Citations from Short-Term Linguistic Influence
AUTHORS: Sandeep Soni ; David Bamman ; Jacob Eisenstein
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.CY, cs.SI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, papers may be cited for many reasons, and citation count offers limited information about the extent to which a paper affected the content of subsequent publications. We therefore propose a novel method to quantify linguistic influence in timestamped document collections.

70, TITLE: Vitruvio: 3D Building Meshes Via Single Perspective Sketches
AUTHORS: Alberto Tono ; Martin Fischer
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.GR, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: If previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) data-driven methods for single view reconstruction (SVR) showed outstanding results in the reconstruction process from a single image or sketch, they lacked specific applications, analysis, and experiments in the AEC. Therefore, this research addresses this gap, introducing a deep learning method: Vitruvio.

This motivates the research on partial-label classification, where only a limited number of labels are annotated and the others are missing.

In this paper, we propose a novel yet effective method for SOD, coined SODGAN, which can generate infinite high-quality image-mask pairs requiring only a few labeled data, and these synthesized pairs can replace the human-labeled DUTS-TR to train any off-the-shelf SOD model.
