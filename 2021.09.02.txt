60, TITLE:	Towards Learning A Vocabulary of Visual Concepts and Operators Using Deep Neural Networks
AUTHORS:	Sunil Kumar Vengalil ; Neelam Sinha
CATEGORY:	cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Deep neural networks have become the default choice for many 
applications like image and video recognition, segmentation and other 
image and video related tasks.However, a critical challenge with these 
models is the lack of explainability.This requirement of generating 
explainable predictions has motivated the research community to perform 
various analysis on trained models.In this study, we analyze the learned
 feature maps of trained models using MNIST images for achieving more 
explainable predictions.Our study is focused on deriving a set of 
primitive elements, here called visual concepts, that can be used to 
generate any arbitrary sample from the data generating distribution.We 
derive the primitive elements from the feature maps learned by the 
model.We illustrate the idea by generating visual concepts from a 
Variational Autoencoder trained using MNIST images.We augment the 
training data of MNIST dataset by adding about 60,000 new images 
generated with visual concepts chosen at random.With this we were able 
to reduce the reconstruction loss (mean square error) from an initial 
value of 120 without augmentation to 60 with augmentation.Our approach 
is a first step towards the final goal of achieving trained deep neural 
network models whose predictions, features in hidden layers and the 
learned filters can be well explained.Such a model when deployed in 
production can easily be modified to adapt to new data, whereas existing
 deep learning models need a re training or fine tuning.

78, TITLE:	Mean Absorption Estimation from Room Impulse Responses Using Virtually Supervised Learning
AUTHORS:	Cédric Foy ; Antoine Deleforge ; Diego Di Carlo
CATEGORY:	cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.SD, eess.AS, physics.class-ph]

response (RIR).

79, TITLE:	Termination Analysis for The $?$-Calculus By Reduction to Sequential Program Termination
AUTHORS:	TSUBASA SHOSHI et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We propose an automated method for proving termination of 
$\pi$-calculus processes, based on a reduction to termination of 
sequential programs: we translate a $\pi$-calculus process to a 
sequential program, so that the termination of the latter implies that 
of the former.

80, TITLE:	Linked Visualisations Via Galois Dependencies
AUTHORS:	Roly Perera ; Minh Nguyen ; Tomas Petricek ; Meng Wang
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We present new language-based dynamic analysis techniques for linking 
visualisations and other structured outputs to data in a fine-grained 
way, allowing a user to interactively explore how data attributes map to
 visual or other output elements by selecting (focusing on) 
substructures of interest.

	We demonstrated that a humanoid robot could perform this inference with
 high accuracy (up to 81.3%) even with a low-resolution camera.

82, TITLE:	Implicit Behavioral Cloning
AUTHORS:	PETE FLORENCE et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We present extensive experiments on this finding, and we provide both 
intuitive insight and theoretical arguments distinguishing the 
properties of implicit models compared to their explicit counterparts, 
particularly with respect to approximating complex, potentially 
discontinuous and multi-valued (set-valued) functions.

CATEGORY:	cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This research's aim is Post-structuralist Discourse Analysis (PDA) of 
Covid-19 phenomenon (inspired by Laclau and Mouffe's Discourse Theory) 
by using Intelligent Data Mining for Persian Society.

85, TITLE:	MergeBERT: Program Merge Conflict Resolution Via Neural Transformers
AUTHORS:	ALEXEY SVYATKOVSKIY et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we introduce MergeBERT, a novel neural program merge 
framework based on the token-level three-way differencing and a 
transformer encoder model.

86, TITLE:	Automatic Non-invasive Cough Detection Based on Accelerometer and Audio Signals
AUTHORS:	Madhurananda Pahar ; Igor Miranda ; Andreas Diacon ; Thomas Niesler
CATEGORY:	cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT:	We present an automatic non-invasive way of detecting cough events based on both accelerometer and audio signals.

87, TITLE:	CTAL: Pre-training Cross-modal Transformer for Audio-and-Language Representations
AUTHORS:	Hang Li ; Yu Kang ; Tianqiao Liu ; Wenbiao Ding ; Zitao Liu
CATEGORY:	cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we present a Cross-modal Transformer for 
Audio-and-Language, i.e., CTAL, which aims to learn the intra-modality 
and inter-modality connections between audio and language through two 
proxy tasks on a large amount of audio-and-language pairs: masked 
language modeling and masked cross-modal acoustic modeling.
