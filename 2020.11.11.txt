HIGHLIGHT:      We explore pretraining strategies including choice of base corpus with the aim of choosing the best strategy for zero-shot multi-speaker end-to-end synthesis.

105, TITLE:     Speaker De-identification System Using Autoencodersand Adversarial Training

AUTHORS:        Fernando M. Espinoza-Cuadros ; Juan M. Perero-Codosero ; Javier Antón-Martín ; Luis A. Hernández-Gómez
CATEGORY:       cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT:      In order to mitigate these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a speaker de-identification system based on adversarial training and autoencoders in order to suppress speaker, gender, and accent information from speech.

106, TITLE:     Estimating Risk-Adjusted Hospital Performance
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05149
AUTHORS:        Eva van Weenen ; Stefan Feuerriegel
COMMENTS:       Accepted at the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data
CATEGORY:       stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.AI, cs.LG, 62P10, I.2.1]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we propose a novel method for measuring hospital performance adjusted for patient risk.

107, TITLE:     Generalized LSTM-based End-to-End Text-Independent Speaker Verification
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04896
AUTHORS:        Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh
COMMENTS:       7 pages, 7 tables, 6 figures. Research Internship at Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, in cooperation with Pattern Recognition Lab at Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. Re-implementation of the paper arXiv:1710.10467 by Wan et al
CATEGORY:       eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we discuss the most recent generalized end-to-end (GE2E) DL technique based on Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) units for TI-SV by Google and compare different scenarios and aspects including utterance duration, training time, and accuracy to prove that our method outperforms the traditional methods.

108, TITLE:     Noise2Stack: Improving Image Restoration By Learning From Volumetric Data
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05105
AUTHORS:        Mikhail Papkov ; Kenny Roberts ; Lee Ann Madissoon ; Omer Bayraktar ; Dmytro Fishman ; Kaupo Palo ; Leopold Parts
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      Here, we introduce Noise2Stack, an extension of the Noise2Noise method to image stacks that takes advantage of a shared signal between spatially neighboring planes. As a part of this work, we release a microscopy dataset to establish a benchmark for the multiplane image denoising.

COMMENTS:       Published in ECCV 2020 Workshop (Advances in Image Manipulation), https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/aim20/
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      The target metric used in this challenge combined the runtime and the perceptual quality of the solutions measured in the user study.

110, TITLE:     Pristine Annotations-based Multi-modal Trained Artificial Intelligence Solution To Triage Chest X-ray For COVID-19
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05186
AUTHORS:        Tao Tan ; Bipul Das ; Ravi Soni ; Mate Fejes ; Sohan Ranjan ; Daniel Attila Szabo ; Vikram Melapudi ; K S Shriram ; Utkarsh Agrawal ; Laszlo Rusko ; Zita Herczeg ; Barbara Darazs ; Pal Tegzes ; Lehel Ferenczi ; Rakesh Mullick ; Gopal Avinash
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:      Our proposed solution differs from existing solutions by industry and academic communities, and demonstrates a functional AI model to triage by inferencing using a single x-ray image, while the deep-learning model is trained using both X-ray and CT data.

111, TITLE:     Classification Of Optics-free Images With Deep Neural Networks
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05132
AUTHORS:        Soren Nelson ; Rajesh Menon
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.optics]
HIGHLIGHT:      We train deep neural networks to perform multi-class detection and binary classification (with accuracy of 92%) on optics-free images without the need for anthropocentric image reconstructions.
