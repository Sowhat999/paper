CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: To improve the ILME-based inference, we propose an internal LM training (ILMT) method to minimize an additional internal LM loss by updating only the E2E model components that affect the internal LM estimation.

91, TITLE: Transfer Learning in Magnetic Resonance Brain Imaging: A Systematic Review
AUTHORS: JUAN MIGUEL VALVERDE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We proposed a new categorization to group specific, widely-used approaches.

92, TITLE: Aura-net : Robust Segmentation of Phase-contrast Microscopy Images with Few Annotations
AUTHORS: Ethan Cohen ; Virginie Uhlmann
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present AURA-net, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation of phase-contrast microscopy images.

93, TITLE: Medical Datasets Collections for Artificial Intelligence-based Medical Image Analysis
AUTHORS: Yang Wen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We collected 32 public datasets, of which 28 for medical imaging and 4 for natural images, to conduct study.

94, TITLE: Learning Domain-agnostic Visual Representation for Computational Pathology Using Medically-irrelevant Style Transfer Augmentation
AUTHORS: Rikiya Yamashita ; Jin Long ; Snikitha Banda ; Jeanne Shen ; Daniel L. Rubin
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose STRAP (Style TRansfer Augmentation for histoPathology), a form of data augmentation based on random style transfer from artistic paintings, for learning domain-agnostic visual representations in computational pathology.

95, TITLE: Prediction of Low-keV Monochromatic Images from Polyenergetic CT Scans for Improved Automatic Detection of Pulmonary Embolism
AUTHORS: CONSTANTIN SEIBOLD et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, 92C55 68T07]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we are training convolutional neural networks~(CNN) that can emulate the generation of monoE images from conventional single energy CT acquisitions.

96, TITLE: Reconstruction and Segmentation of Parallel MR Data Using Image Domain DEEP-SLR
AUTHORS: Aniket Pramanik ; Mathews Jacob
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce an image domain deep network for calibrationless recovery of undersampled PMRI data.

97, TITLE: Mobile-end Tone Mapping Based on Integral Image and Integral Histogram
AUTHORS: Jie Yang ; Mengchen Lin ; Ziyi Liu ; Ulian Shahnovich ; Orly Yadid-Pecht
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce a high performance, mobile-end WDR image tone mapping implementation.

98, TITLE: Image Splicing Detection, Localization and Attribution Via JPEG Primary Quantization Matrix Estimation and Clustering
AUTHORS: Yakun Niu ; Benedetta Tondi ; Yao Zhao ; Rongrong Ni ; Mauro Barni
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we move one step further, proposing an end-to-end system that, in addition to detecting and localizing spliced regions, can also distinguish regions coming from different donor images.
