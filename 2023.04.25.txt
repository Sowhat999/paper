AUTHORS: Dongyang Liu ; Meina Kan ; Shiguang Shan ; Xilin Chen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Considering this, we argue that the similarity between teacher and student features should not be measured merely based on their appearance (i.e., L2 distance), but should, more importantly, be measured by their difference in function, namely how later layers of the network will read, decode, and process them. Therefore, we propose Function-Consistent Feature Distillation (FCFD), which explicitly optimizes the functional similarity between teacher and student features.

AUTHORS: Kuo-Hao Zeng ; Luca Weihs ; Roozbeh Mottaghi ; Ali Farhadi
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: This assumption is limiting; an agent may encounter settings that dramatically alter the impact of actions: a move ahead action on a wet floor may send the agent twice as far as it expects and using the same action with a broken wheel might transform the expected translation into a rotation. Instead of relying that the impact of an action stably reflects its pre-defined semantic meaning, we propose to model the impact of actions on-the-fly using latent embeddings.

To tackle this gap, we propose the first method specifically designed for DG-LSS, which obtains $34.88$ mIoU on the target domain, outperforming all baselines.
