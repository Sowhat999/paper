246, TITLE: Embarassingly Simple Dataset Distillation
AUTHORS: Feng Yunzhen ; Vedantam Ramakrishna ; Kempe Julia
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]

In this work, we tackle dataset distillation at its core by treating it directly as a bilevel optimization problem.

247, TITLE: SCADI: Self-supervised Causal Disentanglement in Latent Variable Models
AUTHORS: Heejeong Nam
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, most existing models for disentangling are weakly supervised, providing information about intrinsic factors, which incurs excessive costs. Therefore, we propose a novel model, SCADI(SElf-supervised CAusal DIsentanglement), that enables the model to discover semantic factors and learn their causal relationships without any supervision.

AUTHORS: EDWARD LEE et. al.

262, TITLE: Towards Transferring Tactile-based Continuous Force Control Policies from Simulation to Robot
AUTHORS: LUCA LACH et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While prior works have either hand-modeled their force controllers, employed model-based approaches, or have not shown sim-to-real transfer, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning approach trained in simulation and then transferred to the robot without further fine-tuning. We therefore present a simulation environment that produces realistic normal forces, which we use to train continuous force control policies.

To cope with these limitations, in this work we propose a new deep learning method which inherits a simple single-band unsupervised pansharpening model nested in a sequential band-wise adaptive scheme, where each band is pansharpened refining the model tuned on the preceding one.
