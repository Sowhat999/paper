AUTHORS: Tao Huang ; Weisheng Dong ; Xin Yuan ; Jinjian Wu ; Guangming Shi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]

AUTHORS: GWANGHYUN KIM et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Several groups proposed deep learning algorithms that quantify the severity of COVID-19 using the array-based COVID-19 labels and localize the lesions with explainability maps.

101, TITLE: Fast Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Inpainting Based on Low-Rank and Sparse Representations
AUTHORS: Lina Zhuang ; Jose M. Bioucas-Dias
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces two very fast and competitive hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration algorithms: fast hyperspectral denoising (FastHyDe), a denoising algorithm able to cope with Gaussian and Poissonian noise, and fast hyperspectral inpainting (FastHyIn), an inpainting algorithm to restore HSIs where some observations from known pixels in some known bands are missing.
