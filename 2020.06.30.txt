COMMENTS:       Open discussion: we show it's fine for a learner (student) to be confident towards a correct low entropy status.

HIGHLIGHT:      To resolve these issues, taking two well-accepted expertise: deep neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise [1] and minimum entropy regularisation principle [2], we propose a simple end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is endorsed by long learning time and high prediction confidence.
