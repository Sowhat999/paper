82, TITLE: Atrous Space Bender U-Net (ASBU-Net/LogiNet)
AUTHORS: Anurag Bansal ; Oleg Ostap ; Miguel Maestre Trueba ; Kristopher Perry

We introduce a fast and efficient convolutional neural network, ASBU-Net, for semantic segmentation of high resolution images that addresses these problems and uses no novelty layers for ease of quantization and embedded hardware support.

93, TITLE: Safe Evaluation For Offline Learning: Are We Ready To Deploy?
AUTHORS: Hager Radi ; Josiah P. Hanna ; Peter Stone ; Matthew E. Taylor
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, it is essential to find a way to estimate how a newly-learned agent will perform if deployed in the target environment before actually deploying it and without the risk of overestimating its true performance. To achieve this, we introduce a framework for safe evaluation of offline learning using approximate high-confidence off-policy evaluation (HCOPE) to estimate the performance of offline policies during learning.

94, TITLE: Learnable Commutative Monoids for Graph Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Euan Ong ; Petar Veli?kovi?

HIGHLIGHT: However, despite the benefits of recurrent aggregators, their $O(V)$ depth makes them both difficult to parallelise and harder to train on large graphs. Inspired by the observation that a well-behaved aggregator for a GNN is a commutative monoid over its latent space, we propose a framework for constructing learnable, commutative, associative binary operators.
