114, TITLE: Retinex-guided Channel-grouping Based Patch Swap for Arbitrary Style Transfer
AUTHORS: Chang Liu ; Yi Niu ; Mingming Ma ; Fu Li ; Guangming Shi
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Since the finite features harvested from one single aesthetic style image are inadequate to represent the rich textures of the content natural image, existing techniques treat the full-channel style feature patches as simple signal tensors and create new style feature patches via signal-level fusion, which ignore the implicit diversities existed in style features and thus fail for generating better stylised results. In this paper, we propose a Retinex theory guided, channel-grouping based patch swap technique to solve the above challenges.
