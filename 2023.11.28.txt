Specifically, we find that the very last few steps of the denoising (i.e., generation) process strongly correspond to the stylistic information of images, and based on this, we propose to augment the latent features of both the foreground and background images with Gaussians for a direct denoising-based harmonization.

HIGHLIGHT: However, the explosion of user-generated content on social media, which is typically distorted by one or more of many possible unknown impairments, has revealed the limitations of NSS-based IQA models that rely on the simple GSM model. Here, we seek to elaborate the VIF index by deriving useful properties of the Multivariate Generalized Gaussian Distribution (MGGD), and using them to study the behavior of VIF under a Generalized GSM (GGSM) model.

325, TITLE: An Ensemble of 2.5D ResUnet Based Models for Segmentation for Kidney and Masses
AUTHORS: Cancan Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Considering the large range and unbalanced distribution of CT scans' thickness, 2.5D ResUnet are adopted to build an efficient coarse-to-fine semantic segmentation framework in this work.

326, TITLE: A Deep Learning Approach for Marine Snow Synthesis and Removal
AUTHORS: Fernando Galetto ; Guang Deng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a novel method to reduce the marine snow interference using deep learning techniques.

327, TITLE: Leveraging Anatomical Constraints with Uncertainty for Pneumothorax Segmentation
AUTHORS: Han Yuan ; Chuan Hong ; Nguyen Tuan Anh Tran ; Xinxing Xu ; Nan Liu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel approach that incorporates the lung+ space as a constraint during DL model training for pneumothorax segmentation on 2D chest radiographs.

328, TITLE: Eye Disease Prediction Using Ensemble Learning and Attention on OCT Scans
AUTHORS: Gauri Naik ; Nandini Narvekar ; Dimple Agarwal ; Nishita Nandanwar ; Himangi Pande
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel method for efficient detection of eye diseases from OCT images.

329, TITLE: Cell Maps Representation For Lung Adenocarcinoma Growth Patterns Classification In Whole Slide Images
AUTHORS: ARWA AL-RUBAIAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a novel machine learning pipeline capable of classifying tissue tiles into one of the five patterns or as non-tumor, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUCROC) score of 0.97.

330, TITLE: View It Like A Radiologist: Shifted Windows for Deep Learning Augmentation of CT Images
AUTHORS: Eirik A. �stmo ; Kristoffer K. Wickstr�m ; Keyur Radiya ; Michael C. Kampffmeyer ; Robert Jenssen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: For contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) images in particular, the signals producing the voxel intensities have physical meaning, which is lost during preprocessing and augmentation when treating such images as natural images. To address this, we propose a novel preprocessing and intensity augmentation scheme inspired by how radiologists leverage multiple viewing windows when evaluating CT images.

331, TITLE: Fine-Grained Unsupervised Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation for Vestibular Schwannoma Segmentation
AUTHORS: Luyi Han ; Tao Tan ; Ritse Mann
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We focus on introducing a fine-grained unsupervised framework for domain adaptation to facilitate cross-modality segmentation of vestibular schwannoma (VS) and cochlea.
