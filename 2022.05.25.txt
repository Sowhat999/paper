HIGHLIGHT: We develop an intermediate representation (IR) for tensor operations called branched iteration graph which specifies breakdown of the computation into smaller ones (kernel distribution) and then fuse (loop fusion) outermost dimensions of the loop nests, while the innermost dimensions are distributed, to increase data locality. We describe exchanges of intermediate results between space iteration spaces, transformation in the IR, and its programmatic invocation.

167, TITLE: Deep Learning Meets Software Engineering: A Survey on Pre-Trained Models of Source Code
AUTHORS: Changan Niu ; Chuanyi Li ; Bin Luo ; Vincent Ng
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In particular, the development and use of pre-trained models of source code has enabled state-of-the-art results to be achieved on a wide variety of SE tasks. This paper provides an overview of this rapidly advancing field of research and reflects on future research directions.

168, TITLE: Adaptive Few-Shot Learning Algorithm for Rare Sound Event Detection

AUTHORS: Yao-Ming Kuo ; Shanq-Jang Ruan ; Yu-Chin Chen ; Ya-Wen Tu
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: This article describes a system for analyzing acoustic data in order to assist in the diagnosis and classification of children's speech disorders using a computer.

170, TITLE: Learning Multi-scale Functional Representations of Proteins from Single-cell Microscopy Data
AUTHORS: Anastasia Razdaibiedina ; Alexander Brechalov
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.MN]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we revisit deep learning models used for classifying major subcellular localizations, and evaluate representations extracted from their final layers.

171, TITLE: Detecting Deforestation from Sentinel-1 Data in The Absence of Reliable Reference Data
AUTHORS: Johannes N. Hansen ; Edward T. A. Mitchard ; Stuart King
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose and evaluate a novel method for deforestation detection in the absence of reliable reference data which often constitutes the largest practical hurdle.

172, TITLE: Defending A Music Recommender Against Hubness-Based Adversarial Attacks
AUTHORS: Katharina Hoedt ; Arthur Flexer ; Gerhard Widmer
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a new line of defence against attacks which exploit a vulnerability of recommenders that operate in high dimensional data spaces (the so-called hubness problem).

173, TITLE: 3D Helical CT Reconstruction with Memory Efficient Invertible Learned Primal-Dual Method
AUTHORS: Buda Baji? ; Ozan Öktem ; Jevgenija Rudzusika
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We adapt the invertible Learned Primal-Dual (iLPD) deep neural network architecture so that it can be applied to helical 3D CT reconstruction.

174, TITLE: UNet#: A UNet-like Redesigning Skip Connections for Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Ledan Qian ; Xiao Zhou ; Yi Li ; Zhongyi Hu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although UNet3+ can obtain the full-scale aggregation feature map, owing to the small number of neurons in the structure, it does not satisfy the segmentation of tiny objects when the number of samples is small. This paper proposes a novel network structure combining dense skip connections and full-scale skip connections, named UNet-sharp (UNet\#) for its shape similar to symbol \#.

175, TITLE: Generative Models for Reproducible Coronary Calcium Scoring
AUTHORS: SANNE G. M. VAN VELZEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This limitation is especially pronounced in non-ECG-synchronized CT where lesions are more impacted by cardiac motion and partial volume effects. Therefore, we propose a CAC quantification method that does not require a threshold for segmentation of CAC.
