To mitigate such a problem, we propose a mask-augmentation-based local matching network (MALM), where an image-text matching module and a masked self-distillation module benefit each other mutually to learn generalizable cross-modality representations.

In this paper, we start by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification decisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect to the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy.
