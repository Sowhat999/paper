10, TITLE: Scaling In-Context Demonstrations with Structured Attention
AUTHORS: Tianle Cai ; Kaixuan Huang ; Jason D. Lee ; Mengdi Wang

129, TITLE: SegNetr: Rethinking The Local-global Interactions and Skip Connections in U-shaped Networks
AUTHORS: Junlong Cheng ; Chengrui Gao ; Fengjie Wang ; Min Zhu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing U-shaped segmentation networks: 1) mostly focus on designing complex self-attention modules to compensate for the lack of long-term dependence based on convolution operation, which increases the overall number of parameters and computational complexity of the network; 2) simply fuse the features of encoder and decoder, ignoring the connection between their spatial locations. In this paper, we rethink the above problem and build a lightweight medical image segmentation network, called SegNetr.
