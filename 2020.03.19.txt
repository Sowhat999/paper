HIGHLIGHT:      Building on this negative result, we propose and analyze a simple and efficient variant of the iterative Bregman projection (IBP) algorithm, currently the most widely adopted algorithm to solve the FS-WBP.

AUTHORS:        Jindong Gu ; Volker Tresp
HIGHLIGHT:      On our benchmark task where models are trained on the MNIST dataset and tested on the AffNIST dataset, our Aff-CapsNets improve the benchmark performance by a large margin (from 79% to 93.21%), without using a routing mechanism.

AUTHORS:        Nawal Benabbou ; Mithun Chakraborty ; Ayumi Igarashi ; Yair Zick
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we present new results on the fair and efficient allocation of indivisible goods to agents that have monotone, submodular, non-additive valuation functions over bundles.

AUTHORS:        Waqas Sultani ; Mubarak Shah
COMMENTS:       ECCV, 2020, under review

43, TITLE:      Training Quantized Neural Networks with a Full-precision Auxiliary Module
http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11236
AUTHORS:        Bohan Zhuang ; Lingqiao Liu ; Mingkui Tan ; Chunhua Shen ; Ian Reid
COMMENTS:       Accepted to Proc. IEEE Conf. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2020)
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we seek to tackle a challenge in training low-precision networks: the notorious difficulty in propagating gradient through a low-precision network due to the non-differentiable quantization function.

44, TITLE:      Multimodal Shape Completion via Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07717
AUTHORS:        Rundi Wu ; Xuelin Chen ; Yixin Zhuang ; Baoquan Chen
HIGHLIGHT:      Several deep learning methods have been proposed for completing partial data from shape acquisition setups, i.e., filling the regions that were missing in the shape. Hence, we pose a multi-modal shape completion problem, in which we seek to complete the partial shape with multiple outputs by learning a one-to-many mapping.

AUTHORS:        Yurui Ren ; Xiaoming Yu ; Junming Chen ; Thomas H. Li ; Ge Li
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a differentiable global-flow local-attention framework to reassemble the inputs at the feature level.

AUTHORS:        Fan Yang ; Sakriani Sakti ; Yang Wu ; Satoshi Nakamura
COMMENTS:       6 pages, 5 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      To alleviate this issue, we analyze skeleton sequence properties to propose a Double-feature Double-motion Network (DD-Net) for skeleton-based action recognition.

AUTHORS:        Christian Schroeder de Witt ; Bei Peng ; Pierre-Alexandre Kamienny ; Philip Torr ; Wendelin Böhmer ; Shimon Whiteson
HIGHLIGHT:      To answer this question, we propose a second new method, FacMADDPG, which factors MADDPG's critic.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00133
AUTHORS:        Zhengzhe Liu ; Xiaojuan Qi ; Philip Torr
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on fake/real faces, and have two important observations: firstly, the texture of fake faces is substantially different from real ones; secondly, global texture statistics are more robust to image editing and transferable to fake faces from different GANs and datasets.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00385
AUTHORS:        Ismail Elezi ; Sebastiano Vascon ; Alessandro Torcinovich ; Marcello Pelillo ; Laura Leal-Taixe
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose Group Loss, a loss function based on a differentiable label-propagation method that enforces embedding similarity across all samples of a group while promoting, at the same time, low-density regions amongst data points belonging to different groups.

COMMENTS:       International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In order to alleviate this issue, we propose a prediction framework that decouples short-term prediction, linked to internal body dynamics, and long-term prediction, linked to the environment and task constraints.
