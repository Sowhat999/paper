CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In our work, we train a language-agnostic multispeaker model conditioned on a set of phonologically derived features common across different languages, with the goal of achieving cross-lingual speaker adaptation.

94, TITLE: High Quality Streaming Speech Synthesis with Low, Sentence-Length-Independent Latency
AUTHORS: NIKOLAOS ELLINAS et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents an end-to-end text-to-speech system with low latency on a CPU, suitable for real-time applications.

95, TITLE: Cryo-shift: Reducing Domain Shift in Cryo-electron Subtomograms with Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Randomization
AUTHORS: HMRISHAV BANDYOPADHYAY et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we present Cryo-Shift, a fully unsupervised domain adaptation and randomization framework for deep learning-based cross-domain subtomogram classification.

96, TITLE: Single-pass Object-adaptive Data Undersampling and Reconstruction for MRI
AUTHORS: Zhishen Huang ; Saiprasad Ravishankar
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a data-driven sampler using a convolutional neural network, MNet, to provide object-specific sampling patterns adaptive to each scanned object.

97, TITLE: Fast and Light-Weight Network for Single Frame Structured Illumination Microscopy Super-Resolution
AUTHORS: Xi Cheng ; Jun Li ; Qiang Dai ; Zhenyong Fu ; Jian Yang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a single-frame structured illumination microscopy (SF-SIM) based on deep learning.

98, TITLE: Image Super-Resolution Using T-Tetromino Pixels
AUTHORS: Simon Grosche ; Andy Regensky ; Jürgen Seiler ; André Kaup
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To achieve a higher image quality after upscaling, we propose a novel binning concept using tetromino-shaped pixels.

99, TITLE: End-to-end Optimized Image Compression with Competition of Prior Distributions
AUTHORS: Benoit Brummer ; Christophe De Vleeschouwer
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 68T07 (Primary), 68P30 (Secondary), I.4.2]
HIGHLIGHT: We instead propose a compression scheme that uses a single convolutional autoencoder and multiple learned prior distributions working as a competition of experts.

100, TITLE: Segmentation of Lung Tumor from CT Images Using Deep Supervision
AUTHORS: Farhanaz Farheen ; Md. Salman Shamil ; Nabil Ibtehaz ; M. Sohel Rahman
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Variations in learning rates, decay and optimization algorithms while training the network have led to different dice co-efficients, the detailed statistics of which have been included in this paper.
