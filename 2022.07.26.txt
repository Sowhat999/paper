AUTHORS: Zitong Huang ; Yiping Bao ; Bowen Dong ; Erjin Zhou ; Wangmeng Zuo

To overcome this issue, we propose a novel WSOD framework with a new paradigm that switches from weak supervision to noisy supervision (W2N).

HIGHLIGHT: However, addressing the RefSR problem has two critical challenges: (i) It is difficult to match the correspondence between LR and Ref images when they are significantly different; (ii) How to transfer the relevant texture from Ref images to compensate the details for LR images is very challenging. To address these issues of RefSR, this paper proposes a deformable attention Transformer, namely DATSR, with multiple scales, each of which consists of a texture feature encoder (TFE) module, a reference-based deformable attention (RDA) module and a residual feature aggregation (RFA) module.

HIGHLIGHT: Then, we justify that equivariance inductive bias can retain the class feature while invariance inductive bias can remove the environmental feature, leaving the class feature that generalizes to any environmental changes in testing. To impose them on learning, for equivariance, we demonstrate that any off-the-shelf contrastive-based self-supervised feature learning method can be deployed; for invariance, we propose a class-wise invariant risk minimization (IRM) that efficiently tackles the challenge of missing environmental annotation in conventional IRM.

To address these issues, we propose a 3D reconstruction system that leverages the output of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce fully dense depth maps for keyframes that include metric scale.

HIGHLIGHT: Recent advances in variational autoencoders (VAEs) have enabled learning latent manifolds as compact Lie groups, such as $SO(d)$. Since this approach assumes that data lies on a subspace that is homeomorphic to the Lie group itself, we here investigate how this assumption holds in the context of images that are generated by projecting a $d$-dimensional volume with unknown pose in $SO(d)$.
