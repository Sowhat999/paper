AUTHORS: Dmitrii Pavlov
CATEGORY: math.AG [math.AG, cs.SC]
HIGHLIGHT: Such matrices play a significant role in high-dimensional statistics and semidefinite optimization. In this paper, logarithmically sparse matrices are studied from the point of view of computational algebraic geometry: we present a formula for the dimension of the Zariski closure of a set of matrices with a given logarithmic sparsity pattern, give a degree bound for this variety and develop implicitization algorithms that allow to find its defining equations.

8, TITLE: ASQ-IT: Interactive Explanations for Reinforcement-Learning Agents
AUTHORS: Yotam Amitai ; Guy Avni ; Ofra Amir
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: In contrast, literature from the social sciences proposes that meaningful explanations are structured as a dialog between the explainer and the explainee, suggesting a more active role for the user and her communication with the agent. In this paper, we present ASQ-IT -- an interactive tool that presents video clips of the agent acting in its environment based on queries given by the user that describe temporal properties of behaviors of interest.

9, TITLE: Story Shaping: Teaching Agents Human-like Behavior with Stories
AUTHORS: Xiangyu Peng ; Christopher Cui ; Wei Zhou ; Renee Jia ; Mark Riedl
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: Storytelling is a mode for communicating tacit procedural knowledge. We introduce a technique, Story Shaping, in which a reinforcement learning agent infers tacit knowledge from an exemplar story of how to accomplish a task and intrinsically rewards itself for performing actions that make its current environment adhere to that of the inferred story world.

10, TITLE: Language-guided Task Adaptation for Imitation Learning
AUTHORS: Prasoon Goyal ; Raymond J. Mooney ; Scott Niekum
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]

AUTHORS: Vivian Lai ; Yiming Zhang ; Chacha Chen ; Q. Vera Liao ; Chenhao Tan
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.HC, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: As a result, current XAI techniques are often found to be hard to use and lack effectiveness. In this work, we attempt to close these gaps by making AI explanations selective -- a fundamental property of human explanations -- by selectively presenting a subset from a large set of model reasons based on what aligns with the recipient's preferences.

AUTHORS: Andrea Piergentili ; Dennis Fucci ; Beatrice Savoldi ; Luisa Bentivogli ; Matteo Negri
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we discuss Gender-Neutral Translation (GNT) as a form of gender inclusivity in translation and advocate for its adoption for MT models, which have been found to perpetuate gender bias and discrimination. To this aim, we review a selection of relevant institutional guidelines for Gender-Inclusive Language (GIL) to collect and systematize useful strategies of gender neutralization.

16, TITLE: Conclusion-based Counter-Argument Generation
AUTHORS: Milad Alshomary ; Henning Wachsmuth
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we hypothesize that the key to effective counter-argument generation is to explicitly model the argument's conclusion and to ensure that the stance of the generated counter is opposite to that conclusion.

17, TITLE: Opportunities and Challenges in Neural Dialog Tutoring
AUTHORS: JAKUB MACINA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although there have been significant recent advances in neural conversational systems using large language models and growth in available dialog corpora, dialog tutoring has largely remained unaffected by these advances. In this paper, we rigorously analyze various generative language models on two dialog tutoring datasets for language learning using automatic and human evaluations to understand the new opportunities brought by these advances as well as the challenges we must overcome to build models that would be usable in real educational settings.

18, TITLE: Automated Identification of Disaster News For Crisis Management Using Machine Learning

20, TITLE: Multitask Instruction-based Prompting for Fallacy Recognition
AUTHORS: Tariq Alhindi ; Tuhin Chakrabarty ; Elena Musi ; Smaranda Muresan
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, a big challenge for computational models lies in the fact that fallacies are formulated differently across the datasets with differences in the input format (e.g., question-answer pair, sentence with fallacy fragment), genre (e.g., social media, dialogue, news), as well as types and number of fallacies (from 5 to 18 types per dataset). To move towards solving the fallacy recognition task, we approach these differences across datasets as multiple tasks and show how instruction-based prompting in a multitask setup based on the T5 model improves the results against approaches built for a specific dataset such as T5, BERT or GPT-3.

21, TITLE: PRIMEQA: The Prime Repository for State-of-the-Art MultilingualQuestion Answering Research and Development

22, TITLE: Topic Ontologies for Arguments
AUTHORS: Yamen Ajjour ; Johannes Kiesel ; Benno Stein ; Martin Potthast
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Many computational argumentation tasks, like stance classification, are topic-dependent: the effectiveness of approaches to these tasks significantly depends on whether the approaches were trained on arguments from the same topics as those they are tested on.

25, TITLE: Noisy Parallel Data Alignment
AUTHORS: Ruoyu Xie ; Antonios Anastasopoulos
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, such OCR output is typically noisy, and most word alignment models are not built to work under such noisy conditions. In this work, we study the existing word-level alignment models under noisy settings and aim to make them more robust to noisy data.

26, TITLE: Low-Resource Compositional Semantic Parsing with Concept Pretraining
AUTHORS: SUBENDHU RONGALI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: When we want to improve the capabilities of a voice assistant by adding a new domain, the underlying semantic parsing model needs to be retrained using thousands of annotated examples from the new domain, which is time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we present an architecture to perform such domain adaptation automatically, with only a small amount of metadata about the new domain and without any new training data (zero-shot) or with very few examples (few-shot).

AUTHORS: Xiao He ; Mingrui Zhu ; Nannan Wang ; Xinbo Gao ; Heng Yang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, they ignore the difference between glyphs in different styles and the similarity of glyphs in the same style, which results in artifacts such as local distortions and style inconsistency. To address this issue, we propose a novel font generation approach by learning the Difference between different styles and the Similarity of the same style (DS-Font).

40, TITLE: RangeViT: Towards Vision Transformers for 3D Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving
AUTHORS: ANGELIKA ANDO et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Today, projection-based methods leverage 2D CNNs but recent advances in computer vision show that vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many image-based benchmarks. In this work, we question if projection-based methods for 3D semantic segmentation can benefit from these latest improvements on ViTs.

41, TITLE: RD-NAS: Enhancing One-shot Supernet Ranking Ability Via Ranking Distillation from Zero-cost Proxies

44, TITLE: Wise-IoU: Bounding Box Regression Loss with Dynamic Focusing Mechanism
AUTHORS: Zanjia Tong ; Yuhang Chen ; Zewei Xu ; Rong Yu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Focal-EIoU v1 was proposed to solve this problem, but due to its static focusing mechanism (FM), the potential of non-monotonic FM was not fully exploited. Based on this idea, we propose an IoU-based loss with a dynamic non-monotonic FM named Wise-IoU (WIoU).

50, TITLE: ODOR: The ICPR2022 ODeuropa Challenge on Olfactory Object Recognition
AUTHORS: MATHIAS ZINNEN et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, the task is complicated due to the particularity and historical variance of predefined target objects, which exhibit a large intra-class variance, and the long tail distribution of the dataset labels, with some objects having only very few training examples. These challenges should encourage participants to create innovative approaches using domain adaptation or few-shot learning.

51, TITLE: A Simple Adaptive Unfolding Network for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Artem Latyshev ; Aleksandr I. Panov
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This review considers the existing methods for determining intrinsic motivation based on the world model obtained by the agent. We propose a systematic approach to current research in this field, which consists of three categories of methods, distinguished by the way they utilize a world model in the agent's components: complementary intrinsic reward, exploration policy, and intrinsically motivated goals.

AUTHORS: Anna Winnicki ; R. Srikant
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: A well-known longstanding open problem in this context is to prove the convergence of such a scheme when the value function of a policy is estimated from data collected from a single sample path obtained from implementing the policy (see page 99 of [Sutton and Barto, 2018], page 8 of [Tsitsiklis, 2002]). We present a solution to the open problem by showing that a first-visit version of such a policy iteration scheme indeed converges to the optimal policy provided that the policy improvement step uses lookahead [Silver et al., 2016, Mnih et al., 2016, Silver et al., 2017b] rather than a simple greedy policy improvement.

64, TITLE: Same or Different? Diff-Vectors for Authorship Analysis
AUTHORS: Silvia Corbara ; Alejandro Moreo ; Fabrizio Sebastiani
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In ``classic'' authorship analysis a feature vector represents a document, the value of a feature represents (an increasing function of) the relative frequency of the feature in the document, and the class label represents the author of the document.

67, TITLE: Minimal Value-Equivalent Partial Models for Scalable and Robust Planning in Lifelong Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Safa Alver ; Doina Precup
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the common practice in model-based reinforcement learning is to learn models that model every aspect of the agent's environment, regardless of whether they are important in coming up with optimal decisions or not. In this paper, we argue that such models are not particularly well-suited for performing scalable and robust planning in lifelong reinforcement learning scenarios and we propose new kinds of models that only model the relevant aspects of the environment, which we call "minimal value-equivalent partial models".

AUTHORS: Abhineet Jain ; Jack Kolb ; Harish Ravichandar
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing learning approaches to dexterous manipulation use demonstrations or interactions with the environment to train black-box neural networks that provide little control over how the robot learns the skills or how it would perform post training. These approaches pose significant challenges when implemented on physical platforms given that, during initial stages of training, the robot's behavior could be erratic and potentially harmful to its own hardware, the environment, or any humans in the vicinity.

75, TITLE: Generalized Object Search
AUTHORS: Kaiyu Zheng
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This thesis argues that through using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to model object search while exploiting structures in the human world (e.g., octrees, correlations) and in human-robot interaction (e.g., spatial language), a practical and effective system for generalized object search can be achieved. In support of this argument, I develop methods and systems for (multi-)object search in 3D environments under uncertainty due to limited field of view, occlusion, noisy, unreliable detectors, spatial correlations between objects, and possibly ambiguous spatial language (e.g., "The red car is behind Chase Bank").
