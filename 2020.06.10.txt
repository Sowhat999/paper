HIGHLIGHT:      Based on this data augmentation idea, we formulate a general framework, called Invariant Transform Experience Replay that we present with two techniques: (i) Kaleidoscope Experience Replay exploits reflectional symmetries and (ii) Goal-augmented Experience Replay which takes advantage of lax goal definitions.

AUTHORS:        Simon Telen ; Marc Van Barel ; Jan Verschelde
COMMENTS:       Corrected some mistakes, added efficiency plots
HIGHLIGHT:      We consider the problem of tracking one solution path defined by a polynomial homotopy on a parallel shared memory computer.

43, TITLE:      Learning and Planning in the Feature Deception Problem
http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04833
AUTHORS:        Zheyuan Ryan Shi ; Ariel D. Procaccia ; Kevin S. Chan ; Sridhar Venkatesan ; Noam Ben-Asher ; Nandi O. Leslie ; Charles Kamhoua ; Fei Fang
HIGHLIGHT:      (2) We propose an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal deception strategy given the learned preferences and show that the problem is NP-hard. In order to formally reason about deception, we introduce the feature deception problem (FDP), a domain-independent model and present a learning and planning framework for finding the optimal deception strategy, taking into account the adversary's preferences which are initially unknown to the defender.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14184
AUTHORS:        Wenjie Ding ; Xing Wei ; Yunfeng Qiu ; Rongrong Ji ; Xiaopeng Hong ; Yihong Gong
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we make the first attempt to examine the vulnerability of current person Re-ID models against a dangerous attack method, \ie, the universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) attack, which has been shown to fool classification models with a little overhead.

45, TITLE:      Fast In-place Algorithms for Polynomial Operations: Division, Evaluation, Interpolation
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10304
AUTHORS:        Pascal Giorgi ; Bruno Grenet ; Daniel S. Roche
HIGHLIGHT:      We demonstrate new in-place algorithms for the aforementioned polynomial computations which require only constant extra space and achieve the same asymptotic running time as their out-of-place counterparts.

46, TITLE:      Graph-Based Reasoning over Heterogeneous External Knowledge for Commonsense Question Answering

AUTHORS:        Shangwen Lv ; Daya Guo ; Jingjing Xu ; Duyu Tang ; Nan Duan ; Ming Gong ; Linjun Shou ; Daxin Jiang ; Guihong Cao ; Songlin Hu
COMMENTS:       8 pages, 7 figure, AAAI 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we propose to automatically extract evidence from heterogeneous knowledge sources, and answer questions based on the extracted evidence.

47, TITLE:      Efficient Architecture Search for Continual Learning
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04027
AUTHORS:        Qiang Gao ; Zhipeng Luo ; Diego Klabjan
COMMENTS:       12 pages, 11 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      To reach these goals, we propose a novel approach named as Continual Learning with Efficient Architecture Search, or CLEAS in short.

48, TITLE:      Fighting the COVID-19 Infodemic: Modeling the Perspective of Journalists, Fact-Checkers, Social Media Platforms, Policy Makers, and the Society
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00033
AUTHORS:        Firoj Alam ; Shaden Shaar ; Fahim Dalvi ; Hassan Sajjad ; Alex Nikolov ; Hamdy Mubarak ; Giovanni Da San Martino ; Ahmed Abdelali ; Nadir Durrani ; Kareem Darwish ; Preslav Nakov
HIGHLIGHT:      Thus, here we design, annotate, and release to the research community a new dataset for fine-grained disinformation analysis that (i)focuses on COVID-19, (ii) combines the perspectives and the interests of journalists, fact-checkers, social media platforms, policy makers, and society as a whole, and (iii) covers both English and Arabic.

49, TITLE:      Proving P!=NP in first-order PA
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10080
AUTHORS:        Rupert McCallum
HIGHLIGHT:      We show that it is provable in PA that there is an arithmetically definable sequence $\{\phi_{n}:n \in \omega\}$ of $\Pi^{0}_{2}$-sentences, such that - PRA+$\{\phi_{n}:n \in \omega\}$ is $\Pi^{0}_{2}$-sound and $\Pi^{0}_{1}$-complete - the length of $\phi_{n}$ is bounded above by a polynomial function of $n$ with positive leading coefficient - PRA+$\phi_{n+1}$ always proves 1-consistency of PRA+$\phi_{n}$.

COMMENTS:       18 pages, 10 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a novel framework for inference of model parameters based on reinforcement learning.

HIGHLIGHT:      In this study, we present two language models for Polish based on the popular BERT architecture.
