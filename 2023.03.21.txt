As a first step towards filling these gaps, we aim to complement existing literature by developing a novel logic-based framework to formally and automatically characterize nexus of similarity between tuples of entities within a knowledge base.

We approach such problems with the framework of federated contextual bandits, and develop variants of prominent contextual bandit algorithms from the centralized seting for the federated setting.
