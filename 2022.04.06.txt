AUTHORS: Zixuan Ke ; Mohammad Kachuee ; Sungjin Lee
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel domain-aware contrastive knowledge transfer method called DCMI to (1) identify the shared domain knowledge to encourage positive transfer among similar domains (in particular from head domains to tail domains); (2) isolate the domain-specific knowledge to minimize the negative transfer from dissimilar domains.

92, TITLE: A Data-Driven Framework for Identifying Investment Opportunities in Private Equity
AUTHORS: Samantha Petersone ; Alwin Tan ; Richard Allmendinger ; Sujit Roy ; James Hales
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, as more data about company performance indicators becomes available and the number of different indicators one may want to consider increases, manual crawling and assessment of investment opportunities becomes inefficient and ultimately impossible. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for automated data-driven screening of investment opportunities and thus the recommendation of businesses to invest in.

94, TITLE: Spread Spurious Attribute: Improving Worst-group Accuracy with Spurious Attribute Estimation
AUTHORS: Junhyun Nam ; Jaehyung Kim ; Jaeho Lee ; Jinwoo Shin
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, instead of searching for weaker supervisions, we ask: Given access to a fixed number of samples with spurious attribute annotations, what is the best achievable worst-group loss if we "fully exploit" them? To this end, we propose a pseudo-attribute-based algorithm, coined Spread Spurious Attribute (SSA), for improving the worst-group accuracy.

In this paper we tackle this problem introducing a novel methodology for discovering which features are considered relevant by a trained neural classifier and how they affect the classifier's output, thus obtaining an explanation on its decision.

HIGHLIGHT: So far, evolutionary computation (EC), in particular in the form of genetic programming (GP), represents a key enabler for the discovery of interpretable machine learning (IML) models. In this short paper, we argue that research in GP for IML needs to focus on searching in the space of low-complexity models, by investigating new kinds of search strategies and recombination methods.

108, TITLE: Learning Pneumatic Non-Prehensile Manipulation with A Mobile Blower
AUTHORS: JIMMY WU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Due to the chaotic nature of aerodynamic forces, a blowing controller must (i) continually adapt to unexpected changes from its actions, (ii) maintain fine-grained control, since the slightest misstep can result in large unintended consequences (e.g., scatter objects already in a pile), and (iii) infer long-range plans (e.g., move the robot to strategic blowing locations). We tackle these challenges in the context of deep reinforcement learning, introducing a multi-frequency version of the spatial action maps framework.

109, TITLE: Deep Interactive Motion Prediction and Planning: Playing Games with Motion Prediction Models
AUTHORS: Jose L. Vazquez ; Alexander Liniger ; Wilko Schwarting ; Daniela Rus ; Luc Van Gool
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT: In most classical Autonomous Vehicle (AV) stacks, the prediction and planning layers are separated, limiting the planner to react to predictions that are not informed by the planned trajectory of the AV. This work presents a module that tightly couples these layers via a game-theoretic Model Predictive Controller (MPC) that uses a novel interactive multi-agent neural network policy as part of its predictive model.

HIGHLIGHT: While ML techniques enable dealing with several problems in self-adaptation, such as scalable decision-making, they are also subject to inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on one such challenge that is particularly important for self-adaptation: ML techniques are designed to deal with a set of predefined tasks associated with an operational domain; they have problems to deal with new emerging tasks, such as concept shift in input data that is used for learning.
