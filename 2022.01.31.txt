AUTHORS: Songxiang Liu ; Dan Su ; Dong Yu
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce DiffGAN-TTS, a novel DDPM-based text-to-speech (TTS) model achieving high-fidelity and efficient speech synthesis.

89, TITLE: Calibrating Histopathology Image Classifiers Using Label Smoothing
AUTHORS: Jerry Wei ; Lorenzo Torresani ; Jason Wei ; Saeed Hassanpour
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we ask: can we improve model calibration by endowing histopathology image classifiers with inductive biases about example difficulty?

90, TITLE: Classification of White Blood Cell Leukemia with Low Number of Interpretable and Explainable Features
AUTHORS: William Franz Lamberti
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, we present an XAI model which uses only 24 explainable and interpretable features and is highly competitive to other approaches by outperforming them by about 4.38\%.

91, TITLE: Computer-aided Recognition and Assessment of A Porous Bioelastomer on Ultrasound Images for Regenerative Medicine Applications
AUTHORS: DUN WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a joint algorithm for the bioelastomer's contour detection and a texture feature extraction method for monitoring the degradation behavior of the bioelastomer.

92, TITLE: Carotid Artery Wall Segmentation in Ultrasound Image Sequences Using A Deep Convolutional Neural Network
AUTHORS: Nolann Lainé ; Guillaume Zahnd ; Herv é Liebgott ; Maciej Orkisz
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.6]
HIGHLIGHT: The objective of this study is the segmentation of the intima-media complex of the common carotid artery, on longitudinal ultrasound images, to measure its thickness.

93, TITLE: Image Superresolution Using Scale-Recurrent Dense Network
AUTHORS: Kuldeep Purohit ; Srimanta Mandal ; A. N. Rajagopalan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a scale recurrent SR architecture built upon units containing series of dense connections within a residual block (Residual Dense Blocks (RDBs)) that allow extraction of abundant local features from the image.

94, TITLE: Deep Networks for Image and Video Super-Resolution
AUTHORS: Kuldeep Purohit ; Srimanta Mandal ; A. N. Rajagopalan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To enable super-resolution for multiple factors, we propose a scale-recurrent framework which reutilizes the filters learnt for lower scale factors recursively for higher factors.

95, TITLE: Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models
AUTHORS: Bahjat Kawar ; Michael Elad ; Stefano Ermon ; Jiaming Song
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This work addresses these issues by introducing Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM), an efficient, unsupervised posterior sampling method.

96, TITLE: Neural JPEG: End-to-End Image Compression Leveraging A Standard JPEG Encoder-Decoder
AUTHORS: Ankur Mali ; Alexander Ororbia ; Daniel Kifer ; Lee Giles
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In light of this, we propose a system that learns to improve the encoding performance by enhancing its internal neural representations on both the encoder and decoder ends, an approach we call Neural JPEG.

97, TITLE: A Review on Deep-Learning Algorithms for Fetal Ultrasound-Image Analysis
AUTHORS: Maria Chiara Fiorentino ; Francesca Pia Villani ; Mariachiara Di Cosmo ; Emanuele Frontoni ; Sara Moccia
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Each paper is analyzed and commented on from both the methodology and application perspective.
