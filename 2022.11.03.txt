CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite monocular 3D object detection having recently made a significant leap forward thanks to the use of pre-trained depth estimators for pseudo-LiDAR recovery, such two-stage methods typically suffer from overfitting and are incapable of explicitly encapsulating the geometric relation between depth and object bounding box. To overcome this limitation, we instead propose OPA-3D, a single-stage, end-to-end, Occlusion-Aware Pixel-Wise Aggregation network that to jointly estimate dense scene depth with depth-bounding box residuals and object bounding boxes, allowing a two-stream detection of 3D objects, leading to significantly more robust detections.
