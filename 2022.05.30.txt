CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: On the other hand, it has also been commonly observed that backdoor poisoning attacks tend to leave a tangible signature in the latent space of the backdoored model i.e. poison samples and clean samples form two separable clusters in the latent space. These observations give rise to the popularity of latent separability assumption, which states that the backdoored DNN models will learn separable latent representations for poison and clean populations.

In this work, we distill some of these ideas for machine learning practitioners and introduce a theory of identity as autopoiesis, circular processes of formation and function.

To tackle this problem, we develop a brand-new DG variant, namely Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), in which the model learns to twist the network parameters to adapt the data from different domains.

AUTHORS: Jacob Granley ; Lucas Relic ; Michael Beyeler
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]

Here we frame this as an end-to-end optimization problem, where a deep neural network encoder is trained to invert a known, fixed forward model that approximates the underlying biological system.
