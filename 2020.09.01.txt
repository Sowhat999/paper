CATEGORY:       cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI.

83, TITLE:      Deep speech inpainting of time-frequency masks
http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09058
AUTHORS:        Mikolaj Kegler ; Pierre Beckmann ; Milos Cernak
COMMENTS:       Accepted to InterSpeech2020
CATEGORY:       cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT:      To address these limitations, here we propose an end-to-end framework for speech inpainting, the context-based retrieval of missing or severely distorted parts of time-frequency representation of speech.

84, TITLE:      Deep Active Lesion Segmentation
http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06933
AUTHORS:        Ali Hatamizadeh ; Assaf Hoogi ; Debleena Sengupta ; Wuyue Lu ; Brian Wilcox ; Daniel Rubin ; Demetri Terzopoulos
COMMENTS:       Accepted to Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2019). Link to source code added
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce Deep Active Lesion Segmentation (DALS), a fully automated segmentation framework for that leverages the powerful nonlinear feature extraction abilities of fully Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the precise boundary delineation abilities of Active Contour Models (ACMs).

85, TITLE:      DR-GAN: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Fine-Grained Lesion Synthesis on Diabetic Retinopathy Images
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04670
AUTHORS:        Yi Zhou ; Boyang Wang ; Xiaodong He ; Shanshan Cui ; Ling Shao
COMMENTS:       Extension work of our MICCAI paper. (Under Review)
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a diabetic retinopathy generative adversarial network (DR-GAN) to synthesize high-resolution fundus images which can be manipulated with arbitrary grading and lesion information.
