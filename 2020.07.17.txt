HIGHLIGHT:      Previous approaches exploit to propagate and aggregate features across video frames by using optical flow-warping.

80, TITLE:      AdvPC: Transferable Adversarial Perturbations on 3D Point Clouds
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00461
AUTHORS:        Abdullah Hamdi ; Sara Rojas ; Ali Thabet ; Bernard Ghanem
COMMENTS:       Presented at European conference on computer vision (ECCV), 2020. The code is available at https://github.com/ajhamdi/AdvPC
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we present novel data-driven adversarial attacks against 3D point cloud networks.

81, TITLE:      Learning Depth With Very Sparse Supervision
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00752
AUTHORS:        Antonio Loquercio ; Alexey Dosovitskiy ; Davide Scaramuzza
COMMENTS:       Accepted for Publication at the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2020, and International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      This paper explores a new approach to learning depth perception requiring neither of those.

82, TITLE:      On Emergent Communication in Competitive Multi-Agent Teams
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01848
AUTHORS:        Paul Pu Liang ; Jeffrey Chen ; Ruslan Salakhutdinov ; Louis-Philippe Morency ; Satwik Kottur
COMMENTS:       AAMAS 2020, code: https://github.com/pliang279/Competitive-Emergent-Communication
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we investigate whether competition for performance from an external, similar agent team could act as a social influence that encourages multi-agent populations to develop better communication protocols for improved performance, compositionality, and convergence speed.
