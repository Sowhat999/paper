AUTHORS: Anssi Kanervisto ; Tomi Kinnunen ; Ville Hautamäki
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Both traditional software-based methods and statistical systems have been successful in protecting against cheating, but recent advances in the automatic generation of content, such as images or speech, threaten the video game industry; they could be used to generate artificial gameplay indistinguishable from that of legitimate human players. To better understand this threat, we begin by reviewing the current state of multiplayer video game cheating, and then proceed to build a proof-of-concept method, GAN-Aimbot.

10, TITLE: Efficient Knowledge Compilation Beyond Weighted Model Counting
AUTHORS: Rafael Kiesel ; Pietro Totis ; Angelika Kimmig
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LO]
HIGHLIGHT: Quantitative extensions of logic programming often require the solution of so called second level inference tasks, i.e., problems that involve a third operation, such as maximization or normalization, on top of addition and multiplication, and thus go beyond the well-known weighted or algebraic model counting setting of probabilistic logic programming under the distribution semantics. We introduce Second Level Algebraic Model Counting (2AMC) as a generic framework for these kinds of problems.

20, TITLE: What Do Models Learn From Training on More Than Text? Measuring Visual Commonsense Knowledge
AUTHORS: Lovisa Hagström ; Richard Johansson

22, TITLE: Prompting to Distill: Boosting Data-Free Knowledge Distillation Via Reinforced Prompt
AUTHORS: Xinyin Ma ; Xinchao Wang ; Gongfan Fang ; Yongliang Shen ; Weiming Lu
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior DFKD approaches, however, have largely relied on hand-crafted priors of the target data distribution for the reconstruction, which can be inevitably biased and often incompetent to capture the intrinsic distributions. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method, termed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language priors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically and grammatically correct.

AUTHORS: Allison Lahnala ; Charles Welch ; Béla Neuendorf ; Lucie Flek
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In particular, the cognitive components of empathy significantly beat the original dataset in almost all experiments, while emotional empathy was tied to less improvement and even underperforming random samples of the original data. This is a particularly implicative insight for NLP work concerning empathy as until recently the research and resources built for it have exclusively considered empathy as an emotional concept.

AUTHORS: FAHIM DALVI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we study: i) what latent concepts exist in the pre-trained BERT model, ii) how the discovered latent concepts align or diverge from classical linguistic hierarchy and iii) how the latent concepts evolve across layers.

AUTHORS: JINGFENG YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Fine-tuning with only few-shot samples, the LMs can easily forget pretrained knowledge, overfit spurious biases, and suffer from compositionally out-of-distribution generalization errors. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel few-shot semantic parsing method -- SeqZero.

46, TITLE: Hero-Gang Neural Model For Named Entity Recognition
AUTHORS: Jinpeng Hu ; Yaling Shen ; Yang Liu ; Xiang Wan ; Tsung-Hui Chang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Unfortunately, although these models can capture effective global context information, they are still limited in the local feature and position information extraction, which is critical in NER. In this paper, to address this limitation, we propose a novel Hero-Gang Neural structure (HGN), including the Hero and Gang module, to leverage both global and local information to promote NER.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present FactPEGASUS, an abstractive summarization model that addresses the problem of factuality during pre-training and fine-tuning: (1) We augment the sentence selection strategy of PEGASUS's (Zhang et al., 2020) pre-training objective to create pseudo-summaries that are both important and factual; (2) We introduce three complementary components for fine-tuning.

49, TITLE: RASAT: Integrating Relational Structures Into Pretrained Seq2Seq Model for Text-to-SQL
AUTHORS: JIEXING QI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.DB, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, introducing these structural relations comes with prices: they often result in a specialized model structure, which largely prohibits the use of large pretrained models in text-to-SQL. To address this problem, we propose RASAT: a Transformer seq2seq architecture augmented with relation-aware self-attention that could leverage a variety of relational structures while at the meantime being able to effectively inherit the pretrained parameters from the T5 model.

AUTHORS: KAITLYN ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While the landscape of NLG evaluation has been well-mapped, practitioners' goals, assumptions, and constraints -- which inform decisions about what, when, and how to evaluate -- are often partially or implicitly stated, or not stated at all. Combining a formative semi-structured interview study of NLG practitioners (N=18) with a survey study of a broader sample of practitioners (N=61), we surface goals, community practices, assumptions, and constraints that shape NLG evaluations, examining their implications and how they embody ethical considerations.

119, TITLE: Real-centric Consistency Learning for Deepfake Detection
AUTHORS: Ruiqi Zha ; Zhichao Lian ; Qianmu Li ; Siqi Gu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Essentially, the target of deepfake detection problem is to represent natural faces and fake faces at the representation space discriminatively, and it reminds us whether we could optimize the feature extraction procedure at the representation space through constraining intra-class consistence and inter-class inconsistence to bring the intra-class representations close and push the inter-class representations apart? Therefore, inspired by contrastive representation learning, we tackle the deepfake detection problem through learning the invariant representations of both classes and propose a novel real-centric consistency learning method.

HIGHLIGHT: Although diffusion models can generate images with high quality and diversity, current conditional diffusion models still can not maintain high similarity with the condition image on image-to-image translation tasks due to the Gaussian noise added in the reverse process. To address these issues, a novel Vector Quantized Brownian Bridge(VQBB) diffusion model is proposed in this paper.

AUTHORS: HAOCHEN HAN et. al.

To address this problem, we highlight the importance of reducing visual distraction in image-based wayfinding by proposing a saliency-guided image inpainting framework.

124, TITLE: From Images to Probabilistic Anatomical Shapes: A Deep Variational Bottleneck Approach
AUTHORS: Jadie Adams ; Shireen Elhabian
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This constraint restricts the learning task to solely estimating pre-defined shape descriptors from 3D images and imposes a linear relationship between this shape representation and the output (i.e., shape) space. In this paper, we propose a principled framework based on the variational information bottleneck theory to relax these assumptions while predicting probabilistic shapes of anatomy directly from images without supervised encoding of shape descriptors.

AUTHORS: Alejandro Romero ; Gianluca Baldassarre ; Richard J. Duro ; Vieri Giuliano Santucci
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: While the majority of works in the field of intrinsically motivated open-ended learning focus on scenarios where goals are independent from each other, only few of them studied the autonomous acquisition of interdependent tasks, and even fewer tackled scenarios where goals involve non-stationary interdependencies. Building on previous works, we tackle these crucial issues at the level of decision making (i.e., building strategies to properly select between goals), and we propose a hierarchical architecture that treating sub-tasks selection as a Markov Decision Process is able to properly learn interdependent skills on the basis of intrinsically generated motivations.
