3, TITLE: Discovering Representative Attribute-stars Via Minimum Description Length
AUTHORS: JIAHONG LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, there are generally two limitations that hinder their practical use: (1) they have multiple parameters that are hard to set but greatly influence results, (2) and they generally focus on identifying complex subgraphs while ignoring relationships between attributes of nodes. To address these problems, we propose a parameter-free algorithm named CSPM (Compressing Star Pattern Miner) which identifies star-shaped patterns that indicate strong correlations among attributes via the concept of conditional entropy and the minimum description length principle.

11, TITLE: On The Limitations of Dataset Balancing: The Lost Battle Against Spurious Correlations
AUTHORS: Roy Schwartz ; Gabriel Stanovsky
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: To mitigate this problem, a common practice is to balance datasets by adding new instances or by filtering out "easy" instances (Sakaguchi et al., 2020), culminating in a recent proposal to eliminate single-word correlations altogether (Gardner et al., 2021). In this opinion paper, we identify that despite these efforts, increasingly-powerful models keep exploiting ever-smaller spurious correlations, and as a result even balancing all single-word features is insufficient for mitigating all of these correlations.

HIGHLIGHT: Based on the observation that targets and sentiments essentially establish relations following the grammatical hierarchy of phrase-clause-sentence structure, it is hopeful to exploit comprehensive syntactic information for better guiding the learning process. Therefore, we introduce the concept of Scope, which outlines a structural text region related to a specific target.

23, TITLE: Data-Driven Adaptive Simultaneous Machine Translation
AUTHORS: GUANGXU XUN et. al.

To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel and efficient training scheme for adaptive SimulMT by augmenting the training corpus with adaptive prefix-to-prefix pairs, while the training complexity remains the same as that of training full-sentence translation models.

AUTHORS: Yizhe Yang ; Yang Gao ; Jiawei Li ; Heyan Huang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it's a challenge for the current Seq2Seq model to acquire knowledge from complex documents and integrate it to perform correct responses without the aid of an explicit semantic structure. To address these issues, we present a novel graph structure, Ground Graph ($G^2$), which models the semantic structure of both dialogue contexts and knowledge documents to facilitate knowledge selection and integration for the task.

38, TITLE: Document-Level Relation Extraction with Sentences Importance Estimation and Focusing
AUTHORS: Wang Xu ; Kehai Chen ; Lili Mou ; Tiejun Zhao
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, we find that such a model is not robust and exhibits bizarre behaviors: it predicts correctly when an entire test document is fed as input, but errs when non-evidence sentences are removed. To this end, we propose a Sentence Importance Estimation and Focusing (SIEF) framework for DocRE, where we design a sentence importance score and a sentence focusing loss, encouraging DocRE models to focus on evidence sentences.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing methods often rely on pure visual matching or consider temporal constraint, but ignore the spatial information of the camera network. To address this problem, we propose a framework of person retrieval based on cross-camera trajectory generation which integrates both temporal and spatial information.

84, TITLE: Relevance-based Margin for Contrastively-trained Video Retrieval Models
AUTHORS: Alex Falcon ; Swathikiran Sudhakaran ; Giuseppe Serra ; Sergio Escalera ; Oswald Lanz
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]

99, TITLE: Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Conditional Generative Models
AUTHORS: Shin'ya Yamaguchi ; Sekitoshi Kanai ; Atsutoshi Kumagai ; Daiki Chijiwa ; Hisashi Kashima
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these all assumptions are difficult to hold in practical settings because the target task rarely has the same labels as the source task, the source dataset access is restricted due to licensing and storage costs, and the target architecture is often specialized to each task. To transfer source knowledge without these assumptions, we propose a transfer learning method that uses deep generative models and is composed of the following two stages: pseudo pre-training (PP) and pseudo semi-supervised learning (P-SSL).

100, TITLE: Can Deep Learning Match The Efficiency of Human Visual Long-term Memory to Store Object Details?
AUTHORS: A. Emin Orhan
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE, q-bio.NC]

We answer this in the negative: even in the best case, models learning via gradient descent appear to require approximately 10 exposures to the same visual materials in order to reach a recognition memory performance humans achieve after only a single exposure.
