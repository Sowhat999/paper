HIGHLIGHT: The prowess that makes few-shot learning desirable in medical image analysis is the efficient use of the support image data, which are labelled to classify or segment new classes, a task that otherwise requires substantially more training images and expert annotations. This work describes a fully 3D prototypical few-shot segmentation algorithm, such that the trained networks can be effectively adapted to clinically interesting structures that are absent in training, using only a few labelled images from a different institute.

162, TITLE: Data-Driven Blind Synchronization and Interference Rejection for Digital Communication Signals

HIGHLIGHT: We show that capturing high-resolution temporal structures (nonstationarities), which enables accurate synchronization to both the SOI and the interference, leads to substantial performance gains. With this key insight, we propose a domain-informed neural network (NN) design that is able to improve upon both "off-the-shelf" NNs and classical detection and interference rejection methods, as demonstrated in our simulations.
