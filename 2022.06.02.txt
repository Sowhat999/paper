Based on such an observation, this paper proposes \emph{a simple yet effective} feature alignment loss, termed as Class-Aware Feature Alignment (CAFA), which 1) encourages a model to learn target representations in a class-discriminative manner and 2) effectively mitigates the distribution shifts in test time, simultaneously.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep clustering approach termed strongly augmented contrastive clustering (SACC), which extends the conventional two-augmentation-view paradigm to multiple views and jointly leverages strong and weak augmentations for strengthened deep clustering.

84, TITLE: Predecessor Features
AUTHORS: Duncan Bailey ; Marcelo Mattar
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

Accordingly, we propose "Predecessor Features", an algorithm that achieves this richer form of credit assignment.

AUTHORS: Shunqi Mao ; Chaoyi Zhang ; Heng Wang ; Weidong Cai

HIGHLIGHT: While existing methods attempt to improve the navigation performance with preciously designed path planning or intricate task settings, none has improved the model generalisation on unheard sounds with task settings unchanged. We thus propose a contrastive learning-based method to tackle this challenge by regularising the audio encoder, where the sound-agnostic goal-driven latent representations can be learnt from various audio signals of different classes.
