AUTHORS: Seyedalireza Khoshsirat ; Chandra Kambhamettu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While a wide variety of attention methods have been introduced for this task, they suffer from the following three problems: designs that do not allow the usage of pre-trained networks and do not benefit from large data pre-training, custom designs that are not based on well-grounded previous designs, therefore limiting the learning power of the network, or complicated designs that make it challenging to re-implement or improve them. In this paper, we propose a novel architectural block, which we term Sentence Attention Block, to solve these problems.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing methods mainly rely on sophisticated pipelines to tackle such cross-modal task, and do not explicitly model the object-level spatial context which plays an important role in locating the referred object. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end RVOS framework completely built upon transformers, termed \textit{Fully Transformer-Equipped Architecture} (FTEA), which treats the RVOS task as a mask sequence learning problem and regards all the objects in video as candidate objects.

Therefore, this paper starts from the theory of emotion, taking East Money as an example, crawling user comment titles data from its corresponding stock bar and performing data cleaning.

171, TITLE: Bayesian Sparsification for Deep Neural Networks with Bayesian Model Reduction
AUTHORS: Dimitrije Markovi? ; Karl J. Friston ; Stefan J. Kiebel
