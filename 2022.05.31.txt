AUTHORS: Mengxue Zhang ; Sami Baral ; Neil Heffernan ; Andrew Lan
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these approaches have several key limitations, including i) they use pre-trained language models that are not well-adapted to educational subject domains and/or student-generated text and ii) they almost always train one model per question, ignoring the linkage across a question and result in a significant model storage problem due to the size of advanced language models.

AUTHORS: Harm Derksen ; Visu Makam ; Jeroen Zuiddam
CATEGORY: cs.CC [cs.CC, math.AG, 68Q17, 15A69]
HIGHLIGHT: Since the seminal works of Strassen and Valiant it has been a central theme in algebraic complexity theory to understand the relative complexity of algebraic problems, that is, to understand which algebraic problems (be it bilinear maps like matrix multiplication in Strassen's work, or the determinant and permanent polynomials in Valiant's) can be reduced to each other (under the appropriate notion of reduction). In this paper we determine precisely how many independent scalar multiplications can be reduced to a given bilinear map (this number is called the subrank, and extends the concept of matrix diagonalization to tensors), for essentially all (i.e. generic) bilinear maps.

To address these challenges, we propose an instance-weighted tree-sum method that effectively pools data across diverse groups to output a concise, rule-based model.

We propose a new notion of task relatedness between source and target tasks, and develop a novel approach for representational transfer under this assumption.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DS]
HIGHLIGHT: To ensure group fairness in such a setting, we would desire proportional group representation in every label but not necessarily in every cluster as is done in group fair clustering. We provide algorithms for such problems and show that in contrast to their NP-hard counterparts in group fair clustering, they permit efficient solutions.

186, TITLE: Approximate Conditional Coverage Via Neural Model Approximations
AUTHORS: Allen Schmaltz ; Danielle Rasooly
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL]

Given these challenges, we propose and analyze a data-driven procedure for obtaining empirically reliable approximate conditional coverage, calculating unique quantile thresholds for each label for each test point.

189, TITLE: Learning from Self-Sampled Correct and Partially-Correct Programs
AUTHORS: ANSONG NI et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Compared with typical adversarial training on image tasks, our work is challenged by more random inputs with rich context, and a lack of class labels. To address these challenges, we propose a method based on a semi-supervised adversarial autoencoder that models disentangled semantic features with domain knowledge and provides additional latent labels for the adversarial training.

Under these assumptions, we present an algorithm, called TASID, that learns a robust policy in the target domain, with sample complexity that is polynomial in the horizon, and independent of the number of states, which is not possible without access to some prior knowledge.

AUTHORS: JIANFEI YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing DABP approaches mostly rely on model distillation from the black-box predictor, \emph{i.e.}, training the model with its noisy target-domain predictions, which however inevitably introduces the confirmation bias accumulated from the prediction noises. To mitigate such bias, we propose a new method, named BETA, to incorporate knowledge distillation and noisy label learning into one coherent framework.
