92, TITLE: Dual Generator Offline Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Quan Vuong ; Aviral Kumar ; Sergey Levine ; Yevgen Chebotar
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in practice, GAN-based offline RL methods have not performed as well as alternative approaches, perhaps because the generator is trained to both fool the discriminator and maximize return -- two objectives that can be at odds with each other. In this paper, we show that the issue of conflicting objectives can be resolved by training two generators: one that maximizes return, with the other capturing the ``remainder'' of the data distribution in the offline dataset, such that the mixture of the two is close to the behavior policy.

99, TITLE: On The Informativeness of Supervision Signals
AUTHORS: Ilia Sucholutsky ; Raja Marjieh ; Nori Jacoby ; Thomas L. Griffiths
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Learning transferable representations by training a classifier is a well-established technique in deep learning (e.g., ImageNet pretraining), but it remains an open theoretical question why this kind of task-specific pre-training should result in ''good'' representations that actually capture the underlying structure of the data. We conduct an information-theoretic analysis of several commonly-used supervision signals from contrastive learning and classification to determine how they contribute to representation learning performance and how the dynamics of learning are affected by training parameters such as the number of labels, classes, and dimensions in the training dataset.
