HIGHLIGHT: Given the generally observed ephemerality of the best deep learning approaches (i.e. the extremely quick succession of the SoTA), the main contributions of the paper are its contextualization of modern deep learning architectures with historical background and the elucidation of the current trajectory of volumetric medical image segmentation research.

268, TITLE: Checkerboard Context Model for Efficient Learned Image Compression
AUTHORS: Dailan He ; Yaoyan Zheng ; Baocheng Sun ; Yan Wang ; Hongwei Qin
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a parallelizable checkerboard context model (CCM) to solve the problem.

269, TITLE: Invertible Image Signal Processing
AUTHORS: Yazhou Xing ; Zian Qian ; Qifeng Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To bridge this gap, we design an Invertible Image Signal Processing (InvISP) pipeline, which not only enables rendering visually appealing sRGB images but also allows recovering nearly perfect RAW data.

270, TITLE: Graph Convolutional Networks for Model-Based Learning in Nonlinear Inverse Problems
AUTHORS: William Herzberg ; Daniel B. Rowe ; Andreas Hauptmann ; Sarah J. Hamilton
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.LG, cs.NA, cs.NE, math.NA, math.OC]
HIGHLIGHT: To overcome this, we present a flexible framework to extend model-based learning directly to nonuniform meshes, by interpreting the mesh as a graph and formulating our network architectures using graph convolutional neural networks.
