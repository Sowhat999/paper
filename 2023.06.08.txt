AUTHORS: PAUL PU LIANG et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: We study this challenge of interaction quantification in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio) but when labeling them is time-consuming. Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contributions are the derivations of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting.

165, TITLE: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification
AUTHORS: Paul Pu Liang ; Yun Cheng ; Ruslan Salakhutdinov ; Louis-Philippe Morency
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: In order to perform multimodal fusion, we need to understand the types of interactions that modalities can exhibit: how each modality individually provides information useful for a task and how this information changes in the presence of other modalities. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of how human annotators can be leveraged to annotate two categorizations of multimodal interactions: (1) partial labels, where different randomly assigned annotators annotate the label given the first, second, and both modalities, and (2) counterfactual labels, where the same annotator is tasked to annotate the label given the first modality before giving them the second modality and asking them to explicitly reason about how their answer changes, before proposing an alternative taxonomy based on (3) information decomposition, where annotators annotate the degrees of redundancy: the extent to which modalities individually and together give the same predictions on the task, uniqueness: the extent to which one modality enables a task prediction that the other does not, and synergy: the extent to which only both modalities enable one to make a prediction about the task that one would not otherwise make using either modality individually.
