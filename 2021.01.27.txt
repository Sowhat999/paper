CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes an efficient Evolutionary Multi-objective neural ARchitecture Search (EMARS) framework, which can automatically search for 3D neural architectures based on a well-designed search space for COVID-19 chest CT scan classification.

92, TITLE: Leveraging 3D Information in Unsupervised Brain MRI Segmentation
AUTHORS: BENJAMIN LAMBERT et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To tackle anatomical variability, Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods are proposed, detecting anomalies as outliers of a healthy model learned using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

93, TITLE: Blind Image Denoising and Inpainting Using Robust Hadamard Autoencoders
AUTHORS: Rasika Karkare ; Randy Paffenroth ; Gunjan Mahindre
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we demonstrate how deep autoencoders can be generalized to the case of inpainting and denoising, even when no clean training data is available.

94, TITLE: Learning-Based Patch-Wise Metal Segmentation with Consistency Check
AUTHORS: Tristan M. Gottschalk ; Andreas Maier ; Florian Kordon ; Björn W. Kreher
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study proposes and evaluates a learning-based patch-wise segmentation network and a newly proposed Consistency Check as post-processing step.

95, TITLE: ImageCHD: A 3D Computed Tomography Image Dataset for Classification of Congenital Heart Disease
AUTHORS: XIAOWEI XU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present ImageCHD, the first medical image dataset for CHD classification.

96, TITLE: Glioblastoma Multiforme Patient Survival Prediction
AUTHORS: Snehal Rajput ; Rupal Agravat ; Mohendra Roy ; Mehul S Raval
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, stat.AP]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose survival prognosis models using four regressors operating on handcrafted image-based and radiomics features.

97, TITLE: Quality Assessment of Super-Resolved Omnidirectional Image Quality Using Tangential Views
AUTHORS: Cagri Ozcinar ; Aakanksha Rana
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes an objective, full-reference quality assessment framework which studies quality measurement for ODIs generated by GAN-based and CNN-based SISR methods.

98, TITLE: A Survey and Analysis on Automated Glioma Brain Tumor Segmentation and Overall Patient Survival Prediction
AUTHORS: Rupal Agravat ; Mehul S Raval
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The article aims to survey the advancement of automated methods for Glioma brain tumor segmentation.
