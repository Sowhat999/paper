In this paper, we investigate three different noise robust CV SLC methods and adapt them to be robust for multi-label noise scenarios in RS.

HIGHLIGHT: We present a method to extract coronary vessels from fluoroscopic x-ray sequences.

84, TITLE: Re-thinking and Re-labeling LIDC-IDRI for Robust Pulmonary Cancer Prediction
AUTHORS: HANXIAO ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We demonstrate in this paper that providing new labels by similar nodule retrieval based on metric learning would be an effective re-labeling strategy.

85, TITLE: Deep Learning for Classification of Thyroid Nodules on Ultrasound: Validation on An Independent Dataset
AUTHORS: JINGXI WENG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Methods: Prior study presented an algorithm which is able to detect thyroid nodules and then make malignancy classifications with two ultrasound images.

86, TITLE: Real Image Restoration Via Structure-preserving Complementarity Attention
AUTHORS: Yuanfan Zhang ; Gen Li ; Lei Sun
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, We propose a novel lightweight Complementary Attention Module, which includes a density module and a sparse module, which can cooperatively mine dense and sparse features for feature complementary learning to build an efficient lightweight architecture.

87, TITLE: Extraction of Vascular Wall in Carotid Ultrasound Via A Novel Boundary-Delineation Network
AUTHORS: Qinghua Huang ; Lizhi Jia ; Guanqing Ren ; Xiaoyi Wang ; Chunying Liu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Segmentation errors occur in discontinuous vascular wall boundaries and dark boundaries. To overcome these problems, we propose a new boundary-delineation network (BDNet).

88, TITLE: SuperVessel: Segmenting High-resolution Vessel from Low-resolution Retinal Image
AUTHORS: YAN HU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: If based on low-resolution input, they easily ignore tiny vessels or cause discontinuity of segmented vessels. To solve these problems, the paper proposes an algorithm named SuperVessel, which gives out high-resolution and accurate vessel segmentation using low-resolution images as input.

89, TITLE: Bayesian Optimization-Based Beam Alignment for MmWave MIMO Communication Systems
AUTHORS: Songjie Yang ; Baojuan Liu ; Zhiqin Hong ; Zhongpei Zhang
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we investigate the issue of mmWave BA and present a novel beam alignment scheme on the basis of a machine learning strategy, Bayesian optimization (BO).
