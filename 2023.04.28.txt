HIGHLIGHT: But while the nascent theory of parameterized complexity has allowed us to push beyond the P-NP ``dichotomy'' in classical computational complexity and identify the exact boundaries of tractability for numerous problems, there is no analogue in the domain of sample complexity that could push beyond efficient PAC learnability. As our core contribution, we fill this gap by developing a theory of parameterized PAC learning which allows us to shed new light on several recent PAC learning results that incorporated elements of parameterized complexity.
