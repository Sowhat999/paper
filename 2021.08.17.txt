accepts with probability 1.

AUTHORS:	Seyed Omid Sadjadi
CATEGORY:	cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This document provides a brief description of the National Institute of
 Standards and Technology (NIST) speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) 
conversational telephone speech (CTS) Superset.

158, TITLE:	The Proximal ID Algorithm
AUTHORS:	Ilya Shpitser ; Zach Wood-Doughty ; Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen
CATEGORY:	stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI, 62H05, 62H99]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper we aim to develop a synthesis of the proximal and 
graphical approaches to identification in causal inference to yield the 
most general identification algorithm in multi- variate systems 
currently known - the proximal ID algorithm.

159, TITLE:	Bayesian Parameter Estimations for Grey System Models in Online Traffic Speed Predictions
AUTHORS:	Gurcan Comert ; Negash Begashaw ; Negash G. Medhin
CATEGORY:	stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY, stat.AP]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This paper presents Bayesian parameter estimation for first order Grey 
system models' parameters (or sometimes referred to as hyperparameters).

160, TITLE:	Continuous-Time Spatiotemporal Calibration of A Rolling Shutter Camera---IMU System
AUTHORS:	Jianzhu Huai ; Yuan Zhuang ; Qicheng Yuan ; Yukai Lin
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	To this end, we develop a calibration method for a RS-camera-IMU system
 with continuous-time B-splines by using a calibration target.
