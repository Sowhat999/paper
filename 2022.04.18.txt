HIGHLIGHT: However, in non-idempotent semirings admitting an order satisfying a monotonicity condition (such as the plus-times or log semirings), the notion of shortest string is well-defined. We describe an algorithm which finds the shortest string for a weighted non-deterministic automaton over such semirings using the backwards shortest distance of an equivalent deterministic automaton (DFA) as a heuristic for A* search performed over a companion idempotent semiring, which is proven to return the shortest string.

86, TITLE: Efficient Architecture Search for Diverse Tasks
AUTHORS: Junhong Shen ; Mikhail Khodak ; Ameet Talwalkar
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This dramatically expands the model's capacity to extract features at multiple resolutions for different types of data while only requiring search over the operation space. To overcome the efficiency challenges of naive weight-sharing in this search space, we introduce DASH, a differentiable NAS algorithm that computes the mixture-of-operations using the Fourier diagonalization of convolution, achieving both a better asymptotic complexity and an up-to-10x search time speedup in practice.

87, TITLE: Universal Approximation Property of Invertible Neural Networks
AUTHORS: ISAO ISHIKAWA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: However, their attractive properties often come at the cost of restricting the layer designs, which poses a question on their representation power: can we use these models to approximate sufficiently diverse functions? To answer this question, we have developed a general theoretical framework to investigate the representation power of INNs, building on a structure theorem of differential geometry.

98, TITLE: Ensemble Diverse Hypotheses and Knowledge Distillation for Unsupervised Cross-subject Adaptation
AUTHORS: KUANGEN ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]

AUTHORS: Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem ; Brendan Leigh Ross ; Jesse C. Cresswell ; Anthony L. Caterini
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ME]

In this paper we investigate the pathologies of maximum-likelihood training in the presence of this dimensionality mismatch.

AUTHORS: Mohammad Reza Hosseinzadeh Taher ; Fatemeh Haghighi ; Michael B. Gotway ; Jianming Liang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Our preliminary analysis showed that high global similarity of medical images in terms of anatomy hampers instance discrimination methods for capturing a set of distinct features, negatively impacting their performance on medical downstream tasks. To alleviate this limitation, we have developed a simple yet effective self-supervised framework, called Context-Aware instance Discrimination (CAiD).

107, TITLE: Learning Spatially Varying Pixel Exposures for Motion Deblurring
AUTHORS: Cindy M. Nguyen ; Julien N. P. Martel ; Gordon Wetzstein
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The post-processing algorithm either must deblur a longer exposure that contains relatively little noise or denoise a short exposure that intentionally removes the opportunity for blur at the cost of increased noise. We present a novel approach of leveraging spatially varying pixel exposures for motion deblurring using next-generation focal-plane sensor--processors along with an end-to-end design of these exposures and a machine learning--based motion-deblurring framework.
