This paper shows that instead of hinging on these strenuous operations, quality image representations can be learned by treating scene/multi-label image SSL simply as a multi-label classification problem, which greatly simplifies the learning framework.

To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$Net, a matching-based framework for FS-FG action recognition, which incorporates \textit{multi-view encoding}, \textit{multi-view matching}, and \textit{multi-view fusion} to facilitate embedding encoding, similarity matching, and decision making across multiple viewpoints.
