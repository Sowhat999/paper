AUTHORS:        Bayu A. Nugroho
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, the weights of a training pattern in the loss function are designed based not only on the number of the training patterns in the class but also on the different nodes where one of them treats this training pattern as positive and the others treat it as negative.
