leverages high-level hierarchical representations to learn navigation 
policies.

82, TITLE:	The Application of Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering: A Review Challenging Conventional Wisdom
AUTHORS:	Feras A. Batarseh ; Rasika Mohod ; Abhinav Kumar ; Justin Bui
CATEGORY:	cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:
	The review covers methods between years 1975-2017, for the requirements
 phase, 46 major AI-driven methods are found, 19 for design, 15 for 
development, 68 for testing, and 15 for release and maintenance.

83, TITLE:	The Performance Evaluation of Attention-Based Neural ASR Under Mixed Speech Input
AUTHORS:	Bradley He ; Martin Radfar
CATEGORY:	cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we present the mixtures of speech signals to a popular 
attention-based neural ASR, known as Listen, Attend, and Spell (LAS), at
 different target-to-interference ratio (TIR) and measure the phoneme 
error rate.

84, TITLE:	Taking Cognition Seriously: A Generalised Physics of Cognition
AUTHORS:	Sophie Alyx Taylor ; Son Cao Tran ; Dan V. Nicolau Jr
CATEGORY:	q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI, math.CT, physics.bio-ph]
HIGHLIGHT:	We propose that cognition deserves the same category-theoretic treatment.

85, TITLE:	A Study of Multilingual End-to-End Speech Recognition for Kazakh, Russian, and English
AUTHORS:	Saida Mussakhojayeva ; Yerbolat Khassanov ; Huseyin Atakan Varol
CATEGORY:	eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We study training a single end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech 
recognition (ASR) model for three languages used in Kazakhstan: Kazakh, 
Russian, and English. In addition, we present several datasets for 
training and evaluation purposes.

86, TITLE:	Region-wise Loss for Biomedical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS:	Juan Miguel Valverde ; Jussi Tohka
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:	We propose Region-wise (RW) loss for biomedical image segmentation.

87, TITLE:	From Augmented Microscopy to The Topological Transformer: A New Approach in Cell Image Analysis for Alzheimer's Research
AUTHORS:	Wooseok Jung
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, math.AT, math.ST, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We develop the augmented microscopy method to capture nuclei in a 
brightfield image and the transformer using Unet model to convert an 
input image into a sequence of topological information.

88, TITLE:	Image Augmentation Using A Task Guided Generative Adversarial Network for Age Estimation on Brain MRI
AUTHORS:	Ruizhe Li ; Matteo Bastiani ; Dorothee Auer ; Christian Wagner ; Xin Chen
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, to overcome the data scarcity problem, we propose a 
generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis method.

89, TITLE:	MixMicrobleedNet: Segmentation of Cerebral Microbleeds Using NnU-Net
AUTHORS:	Hugo J. Kuijf
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:	In this work, we explore the use of nnU-Net as a fully automated tool for microbleed segmentation.

90, TITLE:	Wavelet-Based Network For High Dynamic Range Imaging
AUTHORS:	TIANHONG DAI et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we propose a novel frequency-guided end-to-end deep 
neural network (FHDRNet) to conduct HDR fusion in the frequency domain, 
and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to decompose inputs into 
different frequency bands.
