techniques to explain the diagnostic decision by visualizing the 
significant factors in the input image.

157, TITLE:	ANFIC: Image Compression Using Augmented Normalizing Flows
AUTHORS:	Yung-Han Ho ; Chih-Chun Chan ; Wen-Hsiao Peng ; Hsueh-Ming Hang ; Marek Domanski
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This paper introduces an end-to-end learned image compression system, 
termed ANFIC, based on Augmented Normalizing Flows (ANF).

158, TITLE:	Attention-based Multi-scale Gated Recurrent Encoder with Novel Correlation Loss for COVID-19 Progression Prediction
AUTHORS:	AISHIK KONWER et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We present a deep learning-based approach to predict lung infiltrate 
progression from serial chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients.

159, TITLE:	Input Agnostic Deep Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Classification Using Multimodal MRI Images
AUTHORS:	Aidana Massalimova ; Huseyin Atakan Varol
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we utilize a multi-modal deep learning approach in 
classifying normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment and AD classes 
on the basis of structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans 
from the OASIS-3 dataset.

160, TITLE:	Fully Polarimetric SAR and Single-Polarization SAR Image Fusion Network
AUTHORS:	LIUPENG LIN et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	To take advantage of the polarimetric information of the low-resolution
 PolSAR (LR-PolSAR) image and the spatial information of the 
high-resolution single-polarization SAR (HR-SinSAR) image, we propose a 
fusion framework for joint LR-PolSAR image and HR-SinSAR image and 
design a cross-attention mechanism to extract features from the joint 
input data.

161, TITLE:	Federated Whole Prostate Segmentation in MRI with Personalized Neural Architectures
AUTHORS:	HOLGER R. ROTH et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we combine FL with an AutoML technique based on local 
neural architecture search by training a "supernet".

162, TITLE:	Real-Time Mapping of Tissue Properties for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting
AUTHORS:	Yilin Liu ; Yong Chen ; Pew-Thian Yap
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end deep learning framework 
to seamlessly map the tissue properties directly from spiral k-space MRF
 data, thereby avoiding time-consuming processing such as the nonuniform
 fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) and the dictionary-based Fingerprint 
matching.

163, TITLE:	Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation in CT Segmentation By Filtered Back Projection Augmentation
AUTHORS:	Talgat Saparov ; Anvar Kurmukov ; Boris Shirokih ; Mikhail Belyaev
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We propose Filtered Back-Projection Augmentation (FBPAug), a simple and
 surprisingly efficient approach to augment CT images in sinogram space 
emulating reconstruction with different kernels.
