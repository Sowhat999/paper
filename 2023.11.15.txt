Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe them with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration of events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency within their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before are mutually exclusive for any pair of events).

36, TITLE: Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition with Uncertainty-aware Teacher Learning and Student-student Collaborative Learning
AUTHORS: HELAN HU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, we argue that these teacher-student methods achieve limited performance because poor network calibration produces incorrectly pseudo-labeled samples, leading to error propagation. Therefore, we attempt to mitigate this issue by proposing: (1) Uncertainty-aware Teacher Learning that leverages the prediction uncertainty to guide the selection of pseudo-labels, avoiding the number of incorrect pseudo-labels in the self-training stage.

48, TITLE: The ART of LLM Refinement: Ask, Refine, and Trust
AUTHORS: KUMAR SHRIDHAR et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: However, recent empirical evidence points in the opposite direction, suggesting that LLMs often struggle to accurately identify errors when reasoning is involved. To address this, we propose a reasoning with refinement objective called ART: Ask, Refine, and Trust, which asks necessary questions to decide when an LLM should refine its output, and either affirm or withhold trust in its refinement by ranking the refinement and the initial prediction.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called PCFG-NAT, which leverages a specially designed Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) to enhance the ability of NAT models to capture complex dependencies among output tokens.
