84, TITLE: Misclassification in Automated Content Analysis Causes Bias in Regression. Can We Fix It? Yes We Can!
AUTHORS: Nathan TeBlunthuis ; Valerie Hase ; Chung-Hong Chan
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CY, G.3; K.4.0; I.2.6]
HIGHLIGHT: In principle, existing statistical methods can use "gold standard" validation data, such as that created by human annotators, to correct misclassification bias and produce consistent estimates. We introduce and test such methods, including a new method we design and implement in the R package misclassificationmodels, via Monte Carlo simulations designed to reveal each method's limitations, which we also release.

94, TITLE: Assessing The Ability of ChatGPT to Screen Articles for Systematic Reviews
AUTHORS: Eugene Syriani ; Istvan David ; Gauransh Kumar
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CL, cs.IR]
HIGHLIGHT: While screening has traditionally been considered not amenable to automation, the advent of generative AI-driven chatbots, backed with large language models is set to disrupt the field. In this report, we propose an approach to leverage these novel technological developments for automating the screening of SRs.

AUTHORS: Vicky Zhu ; Robert Rosenbaum
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.NE]

HIGHLIGHT: We explore three novel approaches that use personalized content in a neural rescoring step to improve recognition: gazetteers, prompting, and a cross-attention based encoder-decoder model.

99, TITLE: Image Denoising and The Generative Accumulation of Photons
AUTHORS: ALEXANDER KRULL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 68]
HIGHLIGHT: By viewing image formation as the sequential accumulation of photons on a detector grid, we show that a network trained to predict where the next photon could arrive is in fact solving the minimum mean square error (MMSE) denoising task. This new perspective allows us to make three contributions: We present a new strategy for self-supervised denoising, We present a new method for sampling from the posterior of possible solutions by iteratively sampling and adding small numbers of photons to the image.
