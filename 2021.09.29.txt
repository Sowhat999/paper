 between data samples and a simpler low-dimensional latent space.

AUTHORS:	FREDERIK EBERT et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we ask: what would it take to enable practical data 
reuse in robotics for end-to-end skill learning? To evaluate this 
hypothesis, we collect a large multi-domain and multi-task dataset, with
 7,200 demonstrations constituting 71 tasks across 10 environments, and 
empirically study how this data can improve the learning of new tasks in
 new environments.

86, TITLE:	Designed to Cooperate: A Kant-Inspired Ethic of Machine-to-Machine Cooperation
AUTHORS:	Seng W. Loke
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This position paper highlights an ethic of machine-to-machine 
cooperation and machine pro-sociality, and argues that machines capable 
of autonomous sensing, decision-making and action, such as automated 
vehicles and urban robots, owned and used by different self-interested 
parties, and having their own agendas (or interests of their owners) 
should be designed and built to be cooperative in their behaviours, 
especially if they share public spaces.

large corpus of real-world demonstrations.

direct paradigm.
