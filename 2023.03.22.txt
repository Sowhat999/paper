70, TITLE: Performance-aware Approximation of Global Channel Pruning for Multitask CNNs
AUTHORS: Hancheng Ye ; Bo Zhang ; Tao Chen ; Jiayuan Fan ; Bin Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous works focus on either single task model pruning or simply adapting it to multitask scenario, and still face the following problems when handling multitask pruning: 1) Due to the task mismatch, a well-pruned backbone for classification task focuses on preserving filters that can extract category-sensitive information, causing filters that may be useful for other tasks to be pruned during the backbone pruning stage; 2) For multitask predictions, different filters within or between layers are more closely related and interacted than that for single task prediction, making multitask pruning more difficult. Therefore, aiming at multitask model compression, we propose a Performance-Aware Global Channel Pruning (PAGCP) framework.

179, TITLE: 3D Mitochondria Instance Segmentation with Spatio-Temporal Transformers
AUTHORS: OMKAR THAWAKAR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these convolution-based approaches struggle to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the volume mitochondria data, due to their limited local receptive field. To address this, we propose a hybrid encoder-decoder framework based on a split spatio-temporal attention module that efficiently computes spatial and temporal self-attentions in parallel, which are later fused through a deformable convolution.
