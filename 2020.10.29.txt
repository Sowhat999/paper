http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12111
AUTHORS:        Hieu T. Nguyen ; Tung T. Le ; Thang V. Nguyen ; Nhan T. Nguyen
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose in this paper a novel training method that enhances the segmentation results by adding an additional classification branch to the network.

66, TITLE:      Dynamic Point Cloud Denoising Via Manifold-to-Manifold Distance
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08355
AUTHORS:        Wei Hu ; Qianjiang Hu ; Zehua Wang ; Xiang Gao
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we represent dynamic point clouds naturally on spatial-temporal graphs, and exploit the temporal consistency with respect to the underlying surface (manifold).

67, TITLE:      A Transfer Learning Approach For Automated Segmentation Of Prostate Whole Gland And Transition Zone In Diffusion Weighted MRI
http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09541
AUTHORS:        Saman Motamed ; Isha Gujrathi ; Dominik Deniffel ; Anton Oentoro ; Masoom A. Haider ; Farzad Khalvati
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we propose a transfer learning method based on a modified U-net architecture and loss function, for segmentation of prostate whole gland and transition zone in DWIs using a CNN pretrained on a source dataset and tested on the target dataset.
