HIGHLIGHT: However, as the prevalence of AI increases in this domain, such systems will interact through information flow networks created by interacting decision-making entities, leading to often ill-understood multi-AI complex systems. In this paper we describe how these multi-AI systems can arise, even in relatively simple real-world humanitarian response scenarios, and lead to potentially emergent and erratic erroneous behavior.
