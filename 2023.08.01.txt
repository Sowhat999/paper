HIGHLIGHT: To improve the granularity at the aspect level for a better understanding of the service or product, the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to first identify aspects and then determine the user's opinion about them.

47, TITLE: GeneMask: Fast Pretraining of Gene Sequences to Enable Few-Shot Learning
AUTHORS: Soumyadeep Roy ; Jonas Wallat ; Sowmya S Sundaram ; Wolfgang Nejdl ; Niloy Ganguly
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, standard tokenization schemes involve a simple sliding window of tokens like k-mers that do not leverage any gene-based semantics and thus may lead to (trivial) masking of easily predictable sequences and subsequently inefficient Masked Language Modeling (MLM) training. Therefore, we propose a novel masking algorithm, GeneMask, for MLM training of gene sequences, where we randomly identify positions in a gene sequence as mask centers and locally select the span around the mask center with the highest Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) to mask.

AUTHORS: Aitik Gupta ; Dr. Joydip Dhar
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
