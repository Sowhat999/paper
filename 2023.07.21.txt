AUTHORS: Dejia Xu ; Xingqian Xu ; Wenyan Cong ; Humphrey Shi ; Zhangyang Wang

166, TITLE: Exploiting Structure for Optimal Multi-Agent Bayesian Decentralized Estimation
AUTHORS: Christopher Funk ; Ofer Dagan ; Benjamin Noack ; Nisar R. Ahmed
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show that by exploiting the probabilistic independence structure in multi-agent decentralized fusion problems a tighter bound can be found using (i) an expansion to the CI algorithm that uses multiple (non-monolithic) weighting factors instead of one (monolithic) factor in the original CI and (ii) a general optimization scheme that is able to compute optimal bounds and fully exploit an arbitrary dependency structure.
