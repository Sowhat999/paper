AUTHORS: Danel Ahman ; Matija Pretnar

We formalise these ideas in a small core calculus and demonstrate its flexibility using examples ranging from a multi-party web application, to pre-emptive multi-threading, to (cancellable) remote function calls, to a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects.

Innovatively, we make the first attempt at a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for histological artifact restoration, namely ArtiFusion.Specifically, ArtiFusion formulates the artifact region restoration as a gradual denoising process, and its training relies solely on artifact-free images to simplify the training complexity.Furthermore, to capture local-global correlations in the regional artifact restoration, a novel Swin-Transformer denoising architecture is designed, along with a time token scheme.
