86, TITLE: Three Factors to Improve Out-of-Distribution Detection
AUTHORS: Hyunjun Choi ; JaeHo Chung ; Hawook Jeong ; Jin Young Choi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, previous methods have suffered from a trade-off between classification accuracy (ACC) and OOD detection performance (AUROC, FPR, AUPR). To improve this trade-off, we make three contributions: (i) Incorporating a self-knowledge distillation loss can enhance the accuracy of the network; (ii) Sampling semi-hard outlier data for training can improve OOD detection performance with minimal impact on accuracy; (iii) The introduction of our novel supervised contrastive learning can simultaneously improve OOD detection performance and the accuracy of the network.
