95, TITLE: Quality-aware Cine Cardiac MRI Reconstruction and Analysis from Undersampled K-space Data
AUTHORS: INES MACHADO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an end-to-end quality-aware cine short-axis cardiac MRI framework that combines image acquisition and reconstruction with downstream tasks such as segmentation, volume curve analysis and estimation of cardiac functional parameters.

96, TITLE: DeepMTS: Deep Multi-task Learning for Survival Prediction in Patients with Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Using Pretreatment PET/CT
AUTHORS: MINGYUAN MENG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Based on this idea, we proposed a 3D end-to-end Deep Multi-Task Survival model (DeepMTS) for joint survival prediction and tumor segmentation.

97, TITLE: Automated Risk Classification of Colon Biopsies Based on Semantic Segmentation of Histopathology Images
AUTHORS: JOHN-MELLE BOKHORSTA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we present an approach to address two major challenges in automated assessment of CRC histopathology whole-slide images.
