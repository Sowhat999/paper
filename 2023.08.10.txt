HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose three volumetric variations of deep generative models to augment the dataset by generating synthetic skulls, i.e. Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), WGAN-GP hybrid with Variational Autoencoder pretraining (VAE/WGAN-GP) and Introspective Variational Autoencoder (IntroVAE).

HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we perform a "model transfer" (or domain adaptation) of a pretrained DL model into a target area using plot-level measurements and compare performance versus other machine learning models.
