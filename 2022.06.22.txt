Based on this assumption, we propose an EM algorithm to alternatively estimate the travel time of inferred route through weak supervision in E step and retrieve the route based on estimated travel time in M step for sparse trajectories.

To address these issues, we propose a new method called the itshape Propagation with Adaptive Mask then Training (PAMT).

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]

In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical comparison of standard training with a selection of re-initialization methods to answer this question, training over 15,000 models on a variety of image classification benchmarks.

94, TITLE: Identifiability of Deep Generative Models Under Mixture Priors Without Auxiliary Information
AUTHORS: Bohdan Kivva ; Goutham Rajendran ; Pradeep Ravikumar ; Bryon Aragam
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, math.ST, stat.ML, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: At the same time, several works have empirically observed that this doesn't seem to be necessary in practice. In this work, we explain this behavior by showing that for a broad class of generative (i.e. unsupervised) models with universal approximation capabilities, the side information $u$ is not necessary: We prove identifiability of the entire generative model where we do not observe $u$ and only observe the data $x$.
