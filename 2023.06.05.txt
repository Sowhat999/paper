172, TITLE: Towards Robust FastSpeech 2 By Modelling Residual Multimodality
AUTHORS: Fabian Kögel ; Bac Nguyen ; Fabien Cardinaux
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: With MSE loss FastSpeech 2 is limited to learn conditional averages of the training distribution, which might not lie close to a natural sample if the distribution still appears multimodal after all conditioning signals. To alleviate this problem, we introduce TVC-GMM, a mixture model of Trivariate-Chain Gaussian distributions, to model the residual multimodality.

HIGHLIGHT: However, access to high-quality labeled histopathological images of breast cancer is a big challenge that limits the development of accurate and robust deep learning models. In this systematic review, we identified the publicly available datasets of breast H&E stained whole-slide images (WSI) that can be used to develop deep learning algorithms.
