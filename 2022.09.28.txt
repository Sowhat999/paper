In this article, we prove that this is indeed possible to provide an elegant and simple algebraic characterization of functions from the reals to the reals: we provide a characterization of such functions as the smallest class of functions that contains some basic functions, and that is closed by composition, linear length ODEs, and a natural effective limit schema.
