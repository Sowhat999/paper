HIGHLIGHT: Kannan and Lov\'asz proved that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq n \cdot \mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ and the Subspace Flatness Conjecture by Dadush (2012) claims a $O(\log n)$ factor suffices, which would match the lower bound from the work of Kannan and Lov\'asz. We settle this conjecture up to a constant in the exponent by proving that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq O(\log^{7}(n)) \cdot \mu_{KL} (\Lambda,K)$.

To solve these problems, we propose to structurally decouple the modeling of long-term and short-term correlations in an end-to-end framework, Global-to-Local Transformer (GLoT).

AUTHORS: Hongyu Sun ; Yongcai Wang ; Xudong Cai ; Xuewei Bai ; Deying Li
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For example, the image branch in CrossPoint is $\sim$8.3x heavier than the point cloud branch leading to higher complexity and latency.

256, TITLE: Transformer-based Multi-Instance Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Detection
AUTHORS: Zhaofei Wang ; Weijia Zhang ; Min-Ling Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, since such approaches only utilize the highest score proposal and discard the potentially useful information from other proposals, their independent MIL backbone often limits models to salient parts of an object or causes them to detect only one object per class. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel backbone for WSOD based on our tailored Vision Transformer named Weakly Supervised Transformer Detection Network (WSTDN).

AUTHORS: Tri Dung Duong ; Qian Li ; Guandong Xu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although state-of-the-art counterfactual explanation methods are proposed to use variational autoencoder (VAE) to achieve promising improvements, they suffer from two major limitations: 1) the counterfactuals generation is prohibitively slow, which prevents algorithms from being deployed in interactive environments; 2) the counterfactual explanation algorithms produce unstable results due to the randomness in the sampling procedure of variational autoencoder. In this work, to address the above limitations, we design a robust and efficient counterfactual explanation framework, namely CeFlow, which utilizes normalizing flows for the mixed-type of continuous and categorical features.
