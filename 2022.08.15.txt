2, TITLE: Relational Action Bases: Formalization, Effective Safety Verification, and Invariants (Extended Version)
AUTHORS: Silvio Ghilardi ; Alessandro Gianola ; Marco Montali ; Andrey Rivkin
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To make these systems amenable to verification, the amount of information stored in each relational state needs to be bounded, or restrictions are imposed on the preconditions and effects of actions. We introduce the general framework of relational action bases (RABs), which generalizes existing models by lifting both these restrictions: unbounded relational states can be evolved through actions that can quantify both existentially and universally over the data, and that can exploit numerical datatypes with arithmetic predicates.

30, TITLE: Semantic Decomposition Network with Contrastive and Structural Constraints for Dental Plaque Segmentation
AUTHORS: JIAN SHI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that requires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions (i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque) and complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by existing methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network (SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the segmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to learn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the semantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque segmentation.
