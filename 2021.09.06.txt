	To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised UAD 
pre-training algorithm, named Multi-centred Strong Augmentation via 
Contrastive Learning (MSACL).

AUTHORS:	ROSHAN P MATHEWS et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We propose a new unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) framework 
with novel rewards that facilitates unsupervised learning avoiding 
tedious and impractical manual labelling for summarizing ultrasound 
videos to enhance its utility as a triage tool in the emergency 
department (ED) and for use in telemedicine.
