242, TITLE: DA-LSTM: A Dynamic Drift-Adaptive Learning Framework for Interval Load Forecasting with LSTM Networks
AUTHORS: FIRAS BAYRAM et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While the drift magnitude in load forecasting problems can vary significantly over time, existing literature often assumes a fixed drift magnitude threshold, which should be dynamically adjusted rather than fixed during system evolution. To address this gap, in this paper, we propose a dynamic drift-adaptive Long Short-Term Memory (DA-LSTM) framework that can improve the performance of load forecasting models without requiring a drift threshold setting.

To address this issue, we propose the Stackelberg Decision Transformer (STEER), a heuristic approach that resolves the difficulties of hierarchical coordination among agents.

246, TITLE: Quantization in Spiking Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Bernhard A. Moser ; Michael Lunglmayr
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.DM, cs.ET, 82C32, 41A65]
HIGHLIGHT: In spiking neural networks (SNN), at each node, an incoming sequence of weighted Dirac pulses is converted into an output sequence of weighted Dirac pulses by a leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model based on spike aggregation and thresholding. We show that this mapping can be understood as a quantization operator and state a corresponding formula for the quantization error by means of the Alexiewicz norm.

AUTHORS: Samuel Lanthaler ; T. Konstantin Rusch ; Siddhartha Mishra

We introduce an abstract class of neural oscillators that encompasses these architectures and prove that neural oscillators are universal, i.e, they can approximate any continuous and casual operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy.

252, TITLE: Morpheus: Automated Safety Verification of Data-dependent Parser Combinator Programs
AUTHORS: Ashish Mishra ; Suresh Jagannathan
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Verifying applications written using them, however, has proven to be challenging in large part because of the inherently effectful nature of the parsers being composed and the difficulty in reasoning about the arbitrarily rich data-dependent semantic actions that can be associated with parsing actions. In this paper, we address these challenges by defining a parser combinator framework called Morpheus equipped with abstractions for defining composable effects tailored for parsing and semantic actions and a rich specification language used to define safety properties over the constituent parsers comprising a program.
