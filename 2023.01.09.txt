Here we find that only the most-sophisticated AI agent in the study maximizes its payoffs more often than not in the non-social decision task (it does so in 92% of all trials), and this AI agent also exhibits the most-generous altruistic behavior in the dictator game, resembling humans' rates of sharing with other humans in the game.

To address the above issues, we propose a hashing algorithm based on auto-encoders for multi-view binary clustering, which dynamically learns affinity graphs with low-rank constraints and adopts collaboratively learning between auto-encoders and affinity graphs to learn a unified binary code, called Graph-Collaborated Auto-Encoder Hashing for Multi-view Binary Clustering (GCAE).

We decouple this task and propose ReVoLT, a hierarchical framework: (a) an object detection visual front-end, (b) a high-level reasoner (infers semantic sub-goals), (c) an intermediate-level planner (computes geometrical positions), and (d) a low-level controller (executes actions).

In this work, we address these problems by presenting Language-Informed Latent Actions with Corrections (LILAC), a framework for incorporating and adapting to natural language corrections - "to the right," or "no, towards the book" - online, during execution.
