AUTHORS:        Yiyang Zhao ; Linnan Wang ; Yuandong Tian ; Rodrigo Fonseca ; Tian Guo
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we propose few-shot NAS that explores the choice of using multiple super-nets: each super-net is pre-trained to be in charge of a sub-region of the search space.

AUTHORS:        Riccardo Del Gratta
COMMENTS:       Paper submitted to Applied Category Theory 2020 and accepted for Virtual Poster Session
HIGHLIGHT:      In this article, we propose a Category Theory approach to (syntactic) interoperability between linguistic tools.
