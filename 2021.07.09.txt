HIGHLIGHT: To explore these properties of a complex temporal network, we propose a hyperbolic temporal graph network (HTGN) that fully takes advantage of the exponential capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry.

89, TITLE: Duplicate-sensitivity Guided Transformation Synthesis for DBMS Correctness Bug Detection
AUTHORS: Yushan Zhang ; Peisen Yao ; Rongxin Wu ; Charles Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.DB, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces duplicate-sensitivity guided transformation synthesis which automatically finds new transformations by first synthesizing many candidates then filtering the nonequivalent ones.

90, TITLE: Modality Completion Via Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoders for Multi-Modal Glioma Segmentation
AUTHORS: Mohammad Hamghalam ; Alejandro F. Frangi ; Baiying Lei ; Amber L. Simpson
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel model, Multi-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute one or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan.

91, TITLE: Elastic Deformation of Optical Coherence Tomography Images of Diabetic Macular Edema for Deep-learning Models Training: How Far to Go?
AUTHORS: DANIEL BAR-DAVID et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Elastic Deformation of Optical Coherence Tomography Images of Diabetic Macular Edema for Deep-learning Models Training: How Far to Go?

92, TITLE: Regional Differential Information Entropy for Super-Resolution Image Quality Assessment
AUTHORS: Ningyuan Xu ; Jiayan Zhuang ; Jiangjian Xiao ; Chengbin Peng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.3; I.4.4]
HIGHLIGHT: To solve the problem, we proposed a method called regional differential information entropy to measure both of the similarities and perceptual quality.

93, TITLE: Joint Motion Correction and Super Resolution for Cardiac Segmentation Via Latent Optimisation
AUTHORS: SHUO WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here we propose a novel latent optimisation framework that jointly performs motion correction and super resolution for cardiac image segmentations.

94, TITLE: Deep Learning Based Image Retrieval in The JPEG Compressed Domain
AUTHORS: Shrikant Temburwar ; Bulla Rajesh ; Mohammed Javed
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose a unified model for image retrieval which takes DCT coefficients as input and efficiently extracts global and local features directly in the JPEG compressed domain for accurate image retrieval.

95, TITLE: A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Covid-19 Detection Via 3D Chest CT Images
AUTHORS: Shuang Liang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a hybrid deep learning framework named CTNet which combines convolutional neural network and transformer together for the detection of COVID-19 via 3D chest CT images.

96, TITLE: Label-set Loss Functions for Partial Supervision: Application to Fetal Brain 3D MRI Parcellation
AUTHORS: LUCAS FIDON et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose the first axiomatic definition of label-set loss functions that are the loss functions that can handle partially segmented images.

97, TITLE: Atlas-Based Segmentation of Intracochlear Anatomy in Metal Artifact Affected CT Images of The Ear with Co-trained Deep Neural Networks
AUTHORS: JIANING WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose an atlas-based method to segment the intracochlear anatomy (ICA) in the post-implantation CT (Post-CT) images of cochlear implant (CI) recipients that preserves the point-to-point correspondence between the meshes in the atlas and the segmented volumes.
