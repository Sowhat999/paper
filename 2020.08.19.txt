AUTHORS:        Fanqing Lin ; Connor Wilhelm ; Tony Martinez

COMMENTS:       Published in ICML 2020. This version (v.3) is the final camera-ready version of the paper. It contains the re-computed results, based on the open-sourced datasets

HIGHLIGHT:      Future work on source-code embedding can benefit from reusing our benchmark, and from comparing against CuBERT models as a strong baseline. Specifically, first, we curate a massive, deduplicated corpus of 7.4M Python files from GitHub, which we use to pre-train CuBERT, an open-sourced code-understanding BERT model; and, second, we create an open-sourced benchmark that comprises five classification tasks and one program-repair task, akin to code-understanding tasks proposed in the literature before.
