AUTHORS: Joseph Enguehard
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, when applied to language models, these methods produce a path for each word of a sentence simultaneously, which could lead to creating sentences from interpolated words either having no clear meaning, or having a significantly different meaning compared to the original sentence. In order to keep the meaning of these sentences as close as possible to the original one, we propose Sequential Integrated Gradients (SIG), which computes the importance of each word in a sentence by keeping fixed every other words, only creating interpolations between the baseline and the word of interest.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we first analyzed the attention map of the standard NLA from different perspectives and discovered that the resulting probability distribution always has full support for every local feature, which implies a statistical waste of assigning values to irrelevant non-local features, especially for SISR which needs to model long-range dependence with a large number of redundant non-local features. Based on these findings, we introduced a concise yet effective soft thresholding operation to obtain high-similarity-pass attention (HSPA), which is beneficial for generating a more compact and interpretable distribution.

HIGHLIGHT: However, training deep denoising neural networks requires low-dose and normal-dose CT image pairs, which are difficult to obtain in the clinic settings. To address this challenge, we propose a novel fully unsupervised method for low-dose CT image denoising, which is based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model -- a powerful generative model.
