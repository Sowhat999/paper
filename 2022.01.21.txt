89, TITLE: "Project Smells" -- Experiences in Analysing The Software Quality of ML Projects with Mllint
AUTHORS: Bart van Oort ; Luís Cruz ; Babak Loni ; Arie van Deursen
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, 68-06]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce the novel concept of project smells which consider deficits in project management as a more holistic perspective on software quality in ML projects.

90, TITLE: Cross-Lingual Text-to-Speech Using Multi-Task Learning and Speaker Classifier Joint Training
AUTHORS: J. Yang ; Lei He
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Based on the multilingual transformer text-to-speech model, this paper studies a multi-task learning framework to improve the cross-lingual speaker similarity.

91, TITLE: Unsupervised Personalization of An Emotion Recognition System: The Unique Properties of The Externalization of Valence in Speech
AUTHORS: Kusha Sridhar ; Carlos Busso
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.HC, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: This study proposes an unsupervised approach to address this problem by searching for speakers in the train set with similar acoustic patterns as the speaker in the test set.

92, TITLE: Invasion Dynamics in The Biased Voter Process
AUTHORS: Loke Durocher ; Panagiotis Karras ; Andreas Pavlogiannis ; Josef Tkadlec
CATEGORY: q-bio.PE [q-bio.PE, cs.CC, cs.DS, cs.GT, cs.SI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we study the problem of fixation probability maximization under this model: given a budget $k$, find a set of $k$ agents to initiate the invasion that maximizes the fixation probability.
