36, TITLE: The Devil Is in The Labels: Noisy Label Correction for Robust Scene Graph Generation
AUTHORS: LIN LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, almost all existing SGG models have overlooked the ground-truth annotation qualities of prevailing SGG datasets, i.e., they always assume: 1) all the manually annotated positive samples are equally correct; 2) all the un-annotated negative samples are absolutely background. In this paper, we argue that both assumptions are inapplicable to SGG: there are numerous "noisy" groundtruth predicate labels that break these two assumptions, and these noisy samples actually harm the training of unbiased SGG models.

41, TITLE: DETR++: Taming Your Multi-Scale Detection Transformer
AUTHORS: CHI ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, due to the quadratic complexity in the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer, DETR is never able to incorporate multi-scale features as performed in existing CNN-based detectors, leading to inferior results in small object detection. To mitigate this issue and further improve performance of DETR, in this work, we investigate different methods to incorporate multi-scale features and find that a Bi-directional Feature Pyramid (BiFPN) works best with DETR in further raising the detection precision.

42, TITLE: Detection Hub: Unifying Object Detection Datasets Via Query Adaptation on Language Embedding

AUTHORS: Haodong Yuan ; Yudong Zhang ; Shengyin Fan ; Xue Li ; Jian Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: These methods have the following two major defects: place recognition cannot be performed when the distance between the two point clouds is far, and only the rotation angle can be calculated without the offset in the X and Y direction. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel global descriptor, which is built around the Main Object, in this way, descriptors are no longer dependent on the observation position.

We tackle this challenge by proposing a novel approach for quantifying the static and dynamic biases of any spatiotemporal model.

AUTHORS: REDUAN ACHTIBAT et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we introduce the Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP) approach, which combines the local and global perspectives of XAI and thus allows answering both the "where" and "what" questions for individual predictions, without additional constraints imposed.

83, TITLE: Towards A General Purpose CNN for Long Range Dependencies in $\mathrm{N}$D
AUTHORS: DAVID W. ROMERO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we overcome the need for problem-specific CNN architectures with our Continuous Convolutional Neural Network (CCNN): a single CNN architecture equipped with continuous convolutional kernels that can be used for tasks on data of arbitrary resolution, dimensionality and length without structural changes.

84, TITLE: Intra-agent Speech Permits Zero-shot Task Acquisition
AUTHORS: CHEN YAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Through both social language use and internal processes of rehearsal and practice, language learners are able to build high-level, semantic representations that explain their perceptions. Here, we take inspiration from such processes of "inner speech" in humans (Vygotsky, 1934) to better understand the role of intra-agent speech in embodied behavior.

85, TITLE: Imitating Past Successes Can Be Very Suboptimal
AUTHORS: Benjamin Eysenbach ; Soumith Udatha ; Sergey Levine ; Ruslan Salakhutdinov
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it remains unclear how these methods relate to the standard RL objective, reward maximization. In this paper, we prove that existing outcome-conditioned imitation learning methods do not necessarily improve the policy; rather, in some settings they can decrease the expected reward.

90, TITLE: SubStrat: A Subset-Based Strategy for Faster AutoML
AUTHORS: Teddy Lazebnik ; Amit Somech ; Abraham Itzhak Weinberg
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.DB, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: However, when the dataset is large, each individual configuration takes longer to execute, therefore the overall AutoML running times become increasingly high. To this end, we present SubStrat, an AutoML optimization strategy that tackles the data size, rather than configuration space.

91, TITLE: Subject Membership Inference Attacks in Federated Learning
AUTHORS: Anshuman Suri ; Pallika Kanani ; Virendra J. Marathe ; Daniel W. Peterson
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.PL, F.4.1]
HIGHLIGHT: We describe the categorical semantics for a simply typed variant and a simplified dependently typed variant of Cocon, a contextual modal type theory where the box modality mediates between the weak function space that is used to represent higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) trees and the strong function space that describes (recursive) computations about them.

97, TITLE: Combining Genetic Programming and Particle Swarm Optimization to Simplify Rugged Landscapes Exploration
AUTHORS: Gloria Pietropolli ; Giuliamaria Menara ; Mauro Castelli
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]

To address this problem, we propose a novel heuristic method for constructing a smooth surrogate model of the original function.

100, TITLE: Dependently-Typed Data Plane Programming
AUTHORS: Matthias Eichholz ; Eric Hayden Campbell ; Matthias Krebs ; Nate Foster ; Mira Mezini
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, D.3.1; D.2.4]
HIGHLIGHT: Type systems are a lightweight and compositional way to establish program properties, but there is a significant gap between the kinds of properties that can be proved using simple type systems (e.g., SafeP4) and those that can be obtained using full-blown verification tools (e.g., p4v). In this paper, we close this gap by developing $\Pi$4, a dependently-typed version of P4 based on decidable refinements.

112, TITLE: Training Subset Selection for Weak Supervision
AUTHORS: Hunter Lang ; Aravindan Vijayaraghavan ; David Sontag
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Intuitively, there is a tradeoff between the amount of weakly-labeled data and the precision of the weak labels. We explore this tradeoff by combining pretrained data representations with the cut statistic (Muhlenbach et al., 2004) to select (hopefully) high-quality subsets of the weakly-labeled training data.

115, TITLE: HMRNet: High and Multi-Resolution Network with Bidirectional Feature Calibration for Brain Structure Segmentation in Radiotherapy
AUTHORS: HAO FU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite that variants of U-Net are state-of-the-art segmentation models, they have limited performance when dealing with ABCs structures with various shapes and sizes, especially thin structures (e.g., the falx cerebri) that span only few slices. To deal with this problem, we propose a High and Multi-Resolution Network (HMRNet) that consists of a multi-scale feature learning branch and a high-resolution branch, which can maintain the high-resolution contextual information and extract more robust representations of anatomical structures with various scales.

AUTHORS: Huy-Dung Nguyen ; Michaël Clément ; Boris Mansencal ; Pierrick Coupé

122, TITLE: An Efficient Semi-supervised Quality Control System Trained Using Physics-based MRI-artefact Generators and Adversarial Training
AUTHORS: Daniele Ravi ; Frederik Barkhof ; Daniel C. Alexander ; Geoffrey JM Parker ; Arman Eshaghi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In particular, the lack of sufficient scans with artefacts available for training has created a barrier in designing and deploying machine learning in clinical research. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework having four main components: (1) a set of artefact generators inspired by magnetic resonance physics to corrupt brain MRI scans and augment a training dataset, (2) a set of abstract and engineered features to represent images compactly, (3) a feature selection process that depends on the class of artefact to improve classification performance, and (4) a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained to identify artefacts.

To this end, we propose an invertible sharpening network (InvSharpNet) to improve the visual quality of MRI reconstructions.

AUTHORS: HANG YUAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Advances in deep learning for human activity recognition have been relatively limited due to the lack of large labelled datasets.
