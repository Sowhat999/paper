83, TITLE: Cold Start Streaming Learning for Deep Networks
AUTHORS: Cameron R. Wolfe ; Anastasios Kyrillidis
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, math.OC, 68T07, I.2.6; I.2.10; I.4.0]
HIGHLIGHT: Streaming learning (i.e., learning from one data example at a time) has the potential to enable such real-time adaptation, but current approaches i) freeze a majority of network parameters during streaming and ii) are dependent upon offline, base initialization procedures over large subsets of data, which damages performance and limits applicability. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose Cold Start Streaming Learning (CSSL), a simple, end-to-end approach for streaming learning with deep networks that uses a combination of replay and data augmentation to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

84, TITLE: Foundation Models for Semantic Novelty in Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Tarun Gupta ; Peter Karkus ; Tong Che ; Danfei Xu ; Marco Pavone
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Effectively exploring the environment is a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). We address this challenge by defining a novel intrinsic reward based on a foundation model, such as contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP), which can encode a wealth of domain-independent semantic visual-language knowledge about the world.

86, TITLE: Leveraging Offline Data in Online Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Andrew Wagenmaker ; Aldo Pacchiano
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Practical scenarios often motivate an intermediate setting: if we have some set of offline data and, in addition, may also interact with the environment, how can we best use the offline data to minimize the number of online interactions necessary to learn an $\epsilon$-optimal policy? In this work, we consider this setting, which we call the \textsf{FineTuneRL} setting, for MDPs with linear structure.

98, TITLE: Efficient Neural Mapping for Localisation of Unmanned Ground Vehicles
AUTHORS: Christopher J. Holder ; Muhammad Shafique
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be trained to map images of an environment to absolute camera pose within that environment, learning an implicit neural mapping in the process. In this work we evaluate the applicability of such an approach to real-world robotics scenarios, demonstrating that by constraining the problem to 2-dimensions and significantly increasing the quantity of training data, a compact model capable of real-time inference on embedded platforms can be used to achieve localisation accuracy of several centimetres.
