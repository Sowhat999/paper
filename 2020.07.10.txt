80, TITLE:      Which Tasks Should Be Learned Together in Multi-task Learning?
http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07553
AUTHORS:        Trevor Standley ; Amir R. Zamir ; Dawn Chen ; Leonidas Guibas ; Jitendra Malik ; Silvio Savarese
COMMENTS:       Accepted to ICML 2020 See project website at http://taskgrouping.stanford.edu/
HIGHLIGHT:      We study task cooperation and competition in several different learning settings and propose a framework for assigning tasks to a few neural networks such that cooperating tasks are computed by the same neural network, while competing tasks are computed by different networks.

81, TITLE:      Estimation of Ground Contacts from Human Gait by a Wearable Inertial Measurement Unit using machine learning
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02433
AUTHORS:        Muhammad Junaid Umer ; Qaiser Riaz
COMMENTS:       Not completely discussed with supervisor need some improvements in article to prepare a final draft
HIGHLIGHT:      This article addresses the estimation and classification of right and left foot during the healthy human gait based on the IMU sensor data of chest and lower back. For this purpose we have collected an IMU data of 48 subjects by using two smartphones at chest and lower back of the human body and one smart watch at right ankle of the body.
