162, TITLE: Spoofing Attack Detection in The Physical Layer with Robustness to User Movement
AUTHORS: Daniel Romero ; Tien Ngoc Ha ; Peter Gerstoft
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, since channels change over time, for example due to user movement, such approaches are impractical. To sidestep this limitation, this paper proposes a scheme that combines the decisions of a position-change detector based on a deep neural network to distinguish spoofing from movement.
