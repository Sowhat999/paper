AUTHORS: Rutger Campbell ; Florian Hörsch ; Benjamin Moore

We show that the problem of deciding whether a given graph has such a decomposition is NP-complete if both $k$ and $\ell$ are at least $2$, NP-complete if $k\geq 9$ and $\ell =1$, and is in P for $(k,\ell)=(2,1)$.

85, TITLE: Safe Posterior Sampling for Constrained MDPs with Bounded Constraint Violation
AUTHORS: Krishna C Kalagarla ; Rahul Jain ; Pierluigi Nuzzo
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: Some recent papers have made progress on this very challenging problem but either need unsatisfactory assumptions such as knowledge of a safe policy, or have high cumulative regret. We propose the Safe PSRL (posterior sampling-based RL) algorithm that does not need such assumptions and yet performs very well, both in terms of theoretical regret bounds as well as empirically.

86, TITLE: DAG Learning on The Permutahedron

87, TITLE: Variance, Self-Consistency, and Arbitrariness in Fair Classification
AUTHORS: A. Feder Cooper ; Solon Barocas ; Christopher De Sa ; Siddhartha Sen
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: However, even if a model's classification decisions satisfy a fairness metric, it is not necessarily the case that these decisions are equally confident. This becomes clear if we measure variance: We can fix everything in the learning process except the subset of training data, train multiple models, measure (dis)agreement in predictions for each test example, and interpret disagreement to mean that the learning process is more unstable with respect to its classification decision.
