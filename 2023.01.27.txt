We evaluate different vision-language models with multiple datasets across a set of concepts and find (i) all models evaluated show distinct performance differences based on the perceived gender of the person co-occurring with a given concept in the image and that aggregating analyses over all concepts can mask these concerns; (ii) model calibration (i.e. the relationship between accuracy and confidence) also differs distinctly by perceived gender, even when evaluating on similar representations of concepts; and (iii) these observed disparities align with existing gender biases in word embeddings from language models.

88, TITLE: Interpreting Knowledge-based Programs (Extended Version with Proofs)
AUTHORS: Alexander Knapp ; Heribert Mühlberger ; Bernhard Reus
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.LO, D.2.4; F.3.1]
HIGHLIGHT: We apply the technique of a must/cannot analysis invented for synchronous programming languages to the interpretation problem of knowledge-based programs and demonstrate that the resulting constructive interpretation is monotone and has a least fixed point.

89, TITLE: User-customizable Transpilation of Scripting Languages
AUTHORS: Bo Wang ; Aashish Kullori ; Ivica Nikoli? ; Teodora Baluta ; Prateek Saxena
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.SE, D.2.3; D.2.5; D.3.0]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a new transpilation approach that offers fine-grained customizability and reusability of transpilation rules created by others, without burdening the user to understand the global semantics of the given source program.

90, TITLE: MAG$?$: Types for Failure-Prone Communication
AUTHORS: Matthew Alan Le Brun ; Ornela Dardha
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we develop MAG$\pi$ -- a Multiparty, Asynchronous and Generalised $\pi$-calculus, which is the first language and type system to accommodate in unison: (i) the widest range of non-Byzantine faults, including message loss, delays and reordering; crash failures and link failures; and network partitioning; (ii) a novel and most general notion of reliability, taking into account the viewpoint of each participant in the protocol; (iii) a spectrum of network assumptions from the lowest UDP-based network programming to the TCP-based application level.

91, TITLE: Planning Automated Driving with Accident Experience Referencing and Common-sense Inferencing
AUTHORS: Shaobo Qiu ; Ji Li ; Guoxi Chen ; Hong Wang ; Boqi Li
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we present the concept of an Automated Driving Strategical Brain (ADSB): a framework of a scene perception and scene safety evaluation system that works at a higher abstraction level, incorporating experience referencing, common-sense inferring and goal-and-value judging capabilities, to provide a contextual perspective for decision making within automated driving planning.

92, TITLE: Double Deep Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Low Dimensional Sensing Mapless Navigation of Terrestrial Mobile Robots
AUTHORS: LINDA DOTTO DE MORAES et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we present two Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL) approaches to enhance the problem of mapless navigation for a terrestrial mobile robot.

93, TITLE: Optimal Decision Making in Robotic Assembly and Other Trial-and-error Tasks
AUTHORS: James Watson ; Nikolaus Correll
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Assuming task running times to be Poisson distributed, and using a Markov Jump process to capture the dynamics of the underlying Markov Decision Process, we derive a closed form solution that predicts makespan based on the confusion matrix of the failure predictor.

94, TITLE: UHelp: Intelligent Volunteer Search for Mutual Help Communities
AUTHORS: NARDINE OSMAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose uHelp, a platform for building a community of helpful people and supporting community members find the appropriate help within their social network.

95, TITLE: Differential Elimination and Algebraic Invariants of Polynomial Dynamical Systems
AUTHORS: William Simmons ; André Platzer
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, cs.LO, math.AG, math.DS]
HIGHLIGHT: We adapt the elimination-theoretic Rosenfeld-Gr\"{o}bner algorithm to systematically obtain algebraic invariants of polynomial dynamical systems without using Gr\"{o}bner bases or quantifier elimination.

96, TITLE: Two-step Interpretable Modeling of Intensive Care Acquired Infections
AUTHORS: Giacomo Lancia ; Meri Varkila ; Olaf Cremer ; Cristian Spitoni
CATEGORY: stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.NE, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: To go beyond the black box paradigm of artificial neural networks, we propose a parsimonious and robust semi-parametric approach (i.e., a landmarking competing risks model) that combines routinely collected low-resolution data with predictive features extracted from a convolutional neural network, that was trained on high resolution time-dependent information.

97, TITLE: Improving Statistical Fidelity for Neural Image Compression with Implicit Local Likelihood Models
AUTHORS: Matthew J. Muckley ; Alaaeldin El-Nouby ; Karen Ullrich ; Hervé Jégou ; Jakob Verbeek
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.IT, math.IT]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce a non-binary discriminator that is conditioned on quantized local image representations obtained via VQ-VAE autoencoders.

98, TITLE: I-24 MOTION: An Instrument for Freeway Traffic Science
AUTHORS: DEREK GLOUDEMANS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This article describes the design and creation of the instrument, and provides the first publicly available datasets generated from the instrument.

99, TITLE: Anatomy-aware and Acquisition-agnostic Joint Registration with SynthMorph
AUTHORS: Malte Hoffmann ; Andrew Hoopes ; Douglas N. Greve ; Bruce Fischl ; Adrian V. Dalca
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: A majority of affine methods are also agnostic to the anatomy the user wishes to align; the registration will be inaccurate if algorithms consider all structures in the image. We address these shortcomings with a fast, robust, and easy-to-use DL tool for affine and deformable registration of any brain image without preprocessing, right off the MRI scanner.

100, TITLE: TranSOP: Transformer-based Multimodal Classification for Stroke Treatment Outcome Prediction
AUTHORS: Zeynel A. Samak ; Philip Clatworthy ; Majid Mirmehdi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a transformer-based multimodal network (TranSOP) for a classification approach that employs clinical metadata and imaging information, acquired on hospital admission, to predict the functional outcome of stroke treatment based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
