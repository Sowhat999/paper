84, TITLE: On The Implicit Bias of Adam
AUTHORS: Matias D. Cattaneo ; Jason M. Klusowski ; Boris Shigida
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, math.OC, stat.CO, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: It was found that finite step sizes implicitly regularize solutions because terms appearing in the ODEs penalize the two-norm of the loss gradients. We prove that the existence of similar implicit regularization in RMSProp and Adam depends on their hyperparameters and the training stage, but with a different "norm" involved: the corresponding ODE terms either penalize the (perturbed) one-norm of the loss gradients or, on the contrary, hinder its decrease (the latter case being typical).
