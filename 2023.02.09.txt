81, TITLE: Local Law 144: A Critical Analysis of Regression Metrics
AUTHORS: Giulio Filippi ; Sara Zannone ; Airlie Hilliard ; Adriano Koshiyama
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

82, TITLE: Zero-shot Sim2Real Adaptation Across Environments
AUTHORS: Buddhika Laknath Semage ; Thommen George Karimpanal ; Santu Rana ; Svetha Venkatesh
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: Unfortunately, they require a separate residual model for each individual environment configuration (i.e., a fixed setting of environment variables such as mass, friction etc.), and thus are not transferable to new environments quickly. To address this issue, we propose a Reverse Action Transformation (RAT) policy which learns to imitate simulated policies in the real-world.

AUTHORS: Zhongxin Liu ; Zhijie Tang ; Xin Xia ; Xiaohu Yang

To fill this gap, this work proposes a novel Code Change Representation learning approach named CCRep, which can learn to encode code changes as feature vectors for diverse downstream tasks.
