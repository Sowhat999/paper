82, TITLE: Resources and Evaluations for Multi-Distribution Dense Information Retrieval
AUTHORS: Soumya Chatterjee ; Omar Khattab ; Simran Arora
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To evaluate methods for multi-distribution retrieval, we design three benchmarks for this task from existing single-distribution datasets, namely, a dataset based on question answering and two based on entity matching. We propose simple methods for this task which allocate the fixed retrieval budget (top-k passages) strategically across domains to prevent the known domains from consuming most of the budget.

83, TITLE: On The Robustness of Generative Retrieval Models: An Out-of-Distribution Perspective
AUTHORS: Yu-An Liu ; Ruqing Zhang ; Jiafeng Guo ; Wei Chen ; Xueqi Cheng
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To answer this question, firstly, we define OOD robustness from three perspectives in retrieval problems: 1) The query variations; 2) The unforeseen query types; and 3) The unforeseen tasks. Based on this taxonomy, we conduct empirical studies to analyze the OOD robustness of several representative generative retrieval models against dense retrieval models.

84, TITLE: Targeted Collapse Regularized Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection: Black Hole at The Center
AUTHORS: AMIN GHAFOURIAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, q-bio.NC, stat.ML]

87, TITLE: Quantizable Transformers: Removing Outliers By Helping Attention Heads Do Nothing
AUTHORS: Yelysei Bondarenko ; Markus Nagel ; Tijmen Blankevoort
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To achieve the exact zeros needed in the attention matrix for a no-update, the input to the softmax is pushed to be larger and larger during training, causing outliers in other parts of the network. Based on these observations, we propose two simple (independent) modifications to the attention mechanism - clipped softmax and gated attention.

AUTHORS: Bohan Zhou ; Ke Li ; Jiechuan Jiang ; Zongqing Lu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]

AUTHORS: Rafayel Darbinyan ; Hrayr Harutyunyan ; Aram H. Markosyan ; Hrant Khachatrian

To address this, we propose a linear autoencoder training method to separate the representation into core, spurious, and other features.

101, TITLE: Harnessing Mixed Offline Reinforcement Learning Datasets Via Trajectory Weighting
AUTHORS: Zhang-Wei Hong ; Pulkit Agrawal ; Rémi Tachet des Combes ; Romain Laroche
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that in mixed datasets consisting of mostly low-return trajectories and minor high-return trajectories, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms are overly restrained by low-return trajectories and fail to exploit high-performing trajectories to the fullest. To overcome this issue, we show that, in deterministic MDPs with stochastic initial states, the dataset sampling can be re-weighted to induce an artificial dataset whose behavior policy has a higher return.
