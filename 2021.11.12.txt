CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose that instead of directly modeling forward-kinematics, a more useful form of self-modeling is one that could answer space occupancy queries, conditioned on the robot's state.

90, TITLE: From Words to Connections: Word Use Similarity As An Honest Signal Conducive to Employees' Digital Communication
AUTHORS: A. Fronzetti Colladon ; J. Saint-Charles ; P. Mongeau
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL, physics.soc-ph, I.2.7; H.0; J.4; H.4.0]
HIGHLIGHT: To verify our hypothesis, we analyse the communication of close to 1600 employees, interacting on the intranet communication forum of a large company.

91, TITLE: Music Score Expansion with Variable-Length Infilling
AUTHORS: Chih-Pin Tan ; Chin-Jui Chang ; Alvin W. Y. Su ; Yi-Hsuan Yang
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we investigate using the variable-length infilling (VLI) model, which is originally proposed to infill missing segments, to "prolong" existing musical segments at musical boundaries.

92, TITLE: Towards An Efficient Voice Identification Using Wav2Vec2.0 and HuBERT Based on The Quran Reciters Dataset
AUTHORS: Aly Moustafa ; Salah A. Aly
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we develop a deep learning constructed model for Arabic speakers identification by using Wav2Vec2.0 and HuBERT audio representation learning tools.

93, TITLE: A Histopathology Study Comparing Contrastive Semi-Supervised and Fully Supervised Learning
AUTHORS: Lantian Zhang ; Mohamed Amgad ; Lee A. D. Cooper
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we explore self-supervised learning to reduce labeling burdens in computational pathology.

94, TITLE: Full Characterization of Adaptively Strong Majority Voting in Crowdsourcing
AUTHORS: Margarita Boyarskaya ; Panos Ipeirotis
CATEGORY: stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: We show a way to model such {\delta}-margin voting consensus aggregation process using absorbing Markov chains.

95, TITLE: On The Equivalence Between Neural Network and Support Vector Machine
AUTHORS: Yilan Chen ; Wei Huang ; Lam M. Nguyen ; Tsui-Wei Weng
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG, math.OC]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, in this work, we propose to establish the equivalence between NN and SVM, and specifically, the infinitely wide NN trained by soft margin loss and the standard soft margin SVM with NTK trained by subgradient descent.

96, TITLE: Advancing Brain Metastases Detection in T1-Weighted Contrast-Enhanced 3D MRI Using Noisy Student-based Training
AUTHORS: Engin Dikici ; Xuan V. Nguyen ; Matthew Bigelow ; John. L. Ryu ; Luciano M. Prevedello
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study aims to advance the framework with a noisy student-based self-training strategy to make use of a large corpus of unlabeled T1c data (i.e., data without BM segmentations or detections). Accordingly, the work (1) describes the student and teacher CNN architectures, (2) presents data and model noising mechanisms, and (3) introduces a novel pseudo-labeling strategy factoring in the learned BM detection sensitivity of the framework.

97, TITLE: Trustworthy Medical Segmentation with Uncertainty Estimation
AUTHORS: Giuseppina Carannante ; Dimah Dera ; Nidhal C. Bouaynaya ; Rasool Ghulam ; Hassan M. Fathallah-Shaykh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces a new Bayesian deep learning framework for uncertainty quantification in segmentation neural networks, specifically encoder-decoder architectures.

98, TITLE: Related Work on Image Quality Assessment
AUTHORS: Dongxu Wang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This article will review the state-of-the-art image quality assessment algorithms.

99, TITLE: CodEx: A Modular Framework for Joint Temporal De-blurring and Tomographic Reconstruction
AUTHORS: Soumendu Majee ; Selin Aslan ; Charles A. Bouman ; Doga Gursoy
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce CodEx, a modular framework for joint de-blurring and tomographic reconstruction that can effectively invert the motion blur introduced in fly-scanning.
