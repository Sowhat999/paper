1, TITLE: Countably Many Asymptotic Tensor Ranks
AUTHORS: Andreas Blatter ; Jan Draisma ; Filip Rupniewski
CATEGORY: math.AG [math.AG, cs.CC, 15A69]
HIGHLIGHT: In connection with recent work on gaps in the asymptotic subranks of complex tensors the question arose whether the number of nonnegative real numbers that arise as the asymptotic subrank of some complex tensor is countable. In this short note we settle this question in the affirmative, for all tensor invariants that are algebraic in the sense that they are invariant under field automorphisms of the complex numbers.

4, TITLE: HiTSKT: A Hierarchical Transformer Model for Session-Aware Knowledge Tracing
AUTHORS: FUCAI KE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Most existing KT models treat student's learning records as a single continuing sequence, without capturing the sessional shift of students' knowledge state. To address the above issue, we propose a novel hierarchical transformer model, named HiTSKT, comprises an interaction(-level) encoder to capture the knowledge a student acquires within a session, and a session(-level) encoder to summarise acquired knowledge across the past sessions.

49, TITLE: Principled and Efficient Transfer Learning of Deep Models Via Neural Collapse
AUTHORS: XIAO LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, eess.IV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Through the lens of NC, our findings for transfer learning are the following: (i) when pre-training models, preventing intra-class variability collapse (to a certain extent) better preserves the intrinsic structures of the input data, so that it leads to better model transferability; (ii) when fine-tuning models on downstream tasks, obtaining features with more NC on downstream data results in better test accuracy on the given task. The above results not only demystify many widely used heuristics in model pre-training (e.g., data augmentation, projection head, self-supervised learning), but also leads to more efficient and principled fine-tuning method on downstream tasks that we demonstrate through extensive experimental results.
