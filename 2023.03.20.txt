8, TITLE: Learning Towards Selective Data Augmentation for Dialogue Generation
AUTHORS: XIUYING CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We argue that not all cases are beneficial for augmentation task, and the cases suitable for augmentation should obey the following two attributes: (1) low-quality (the dialog model cannot generate a high-quality response for the case), (2) representative (the case should represent the property of the whole dataset). Herein, we explore this idea by proposing a Selective Data Augmentation framework (SDA) for the response generation task.

AUTHORS: Gen Li ; Varun Jampani ; Deqing Sun ; Laura Sevilla-Lara

30, TITLE: Event-based Human Pose Tracking By Spiking Spatiotemporal Transformer
AUTHORS: Shihao Zou ; Yuxuan Mu ; Xinxin Zuo ; Sen Wang ; Li Cheng
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Meanwhile, although the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs, a.k.a. dense deep learning) has been showcased in many event-based tasks, the use of ANNs tends to neglect the fact that compared to the dense frame-based image sequences, the occurrence of events from an event camera is spatiotemporally much sparser. Motivated by the above mentioned issues, we present in this paper a dedicated end-to-end \textit{sparse deep learning} approach for event-based pose tracking: 1) to our knowledge this is the first time that 3D human pose tracking is obtained from events only, thus eliminating the need of accessing to any frame-based images as part of input; 2) our approach is based entirely upon the framework of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which consists of Spike-Element-Wise (SEW) ResNet and our proposed spiking spatiotemporal transformer; 3) a large-scale synthetic dataset is constructed that features a broad and diverse set of annotated 3D human motions, as well as longer hours of event stream data, named SynEventHPD.

41, TITLE: Exploring Sparse Visual Prompt for Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation
AUTHORS: SENQIAO YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Since the previous dense prompts are opaque and mask out continuous spatial details in the prompt regions, it will suffer from inaccurate contextual information extraction and insufficient domain-specific feature transferring when dealing with the dense prediction (i.e. semantic segmentation) DA problems. Therefore, we propose a novel Sparse Visual Domain Prompts (SVDP) approach tailored for addressing domain shift problems in semantic segmentation, which holds minimal discrete trainable parameters (e.g. 10\%) of the prompt and reserves more spatial information.

42, TITLE: MMFace4D: A Large-Scale Multi-Modal 4D Face Dataset for Audio-Driven 3D Face Animation

48, TITLE: ShaRPy: Shape Reconstruction and Hand Pose Estimation from RGB-D with Uncertainty
AUTHORS: VANESSA WIRTH et. al.

Therefore, we propose ShaRPy, the first RGB-D Shape Reconstruction and hand Pose tracking system, which provides uncertainty estimates of the computed pose to guide clinical decision-making.

AUTHORS: Daniele Baieri ; Stefano Esposito ; Filippo Maggioli ; Emanuele Rodolà
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.GR, I.2.6; I.3.7; I.3.5]
HIGHLIGHT: In order to represent 3D motion within this framework, it is often assumed (either explicitly or implicitly) that the transformations which a surface may undergo are homeomorphic: this is not necessarily true, for instance, in the case of fluid dynamics. In order to represent more general classes of deformations, we propose to apply this theoretical framework as regularizers for the optimization of simple 4D implicit functions (such as signed distance fields).
