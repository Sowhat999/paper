90, TITLE: Stroke Lesion Segmentation with Visual Cortex Anatomy Alike Neural Nets
AUTHORS: Chuanlong Li
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Intuitively, this work presents a more brain alike model which mimics the anatomical structure of the human visual cortex.

91, TITLE: COVID-Net CXR-2: An Enhanced Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-ray Images
AUTHORS: MAYA PAVLOVA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: As part of the COVID-Net open source initiative, we introduce COVID-Net CXR-2, an enhanced deep convolutional neural network design for COVID-19 detection from CXR images built using a greater quantity and diversity of patients than the original COVID-Net. To facilitate this, we also introduce a new benchmark dataset composed of 19,203 CXR images from a multinational cohort of 16,656 patients from at least 51 countries, making it the largest, most diverse COVID-19 CXR dataset in open access form.

92, TITLE: One Network to Solve Them All: A Sequential Multi-Task Joint Learning Network Framework for MR Imaging Pipeline
AUTHORS: ZHIWEN WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: To involve these potential relations for further performance improvement, a sequential multi-task joint learning network model is proposed to train a combined end-to-end pipeline in a differentiable way, aiming at exploring the mutual influence among those tasks simultaneously.

93, TITLE: Deep Learning Based RIS Channel Extrapolation with Element-grouping
AUTHORS: Shunbo Zhang ; Shun Zhang ; Feifei Gao ; Jianpeng Ma ; Octavia A. Dobre
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this letter, we consider the acquisition of the cascaded channels, which is a challenging task due to the massive number of passive RIS elements.
