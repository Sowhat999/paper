HIGHLIGHT: The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings [2014] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that the recently discovered families of constant-rate and linear-distance QLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians.

AUTHORS: Maureen de Seyssel ; Guillaume Wisniewski ; Emmanuel Dupoux
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.SD, eess.AS]

In this work, we show that the computational model of LFE introduced by Thorburn, Feldmand and Schatz (2019) can address these two limitations.

22, TITLE: Memory-Guided Multi-View Multi-Domain Fake News Detection
AUTHORS: YONGCHUN ZHU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Based on our analysis, we pose two challenges in multi-domain fake news detection: 1) domain shift, caused by the discrepancy among domains in terms of words, emotions, styles, etc. 2) domain labeling incompleteness, stemming from the real-world categorization that only outputs one single domain label, regardless of topic diversity of a news piece. In this paper, we propose a Memory-guided Multi-view Multi-domain Fake News Detection Framework (M$^3$FEND) to address these two challenges.

In view of this, this paper presents an end-to-end deep image clustering approach termed Vision Transformer for Contrastive Clustering (VTCC), which for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, unifies the Transformer and the contrastive learning for the image clustering task.
