83, TITLE: Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning Can Diverge in Stochastic Environments With Episodic Resets
AUTHORS: Miroslav ?trupl ; Francesco Faccio ; Dylan R. Ashley ; Jürgen Schmidhuber ; Rupesh Kumar Srivastava
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, 68T05, I.2.6]
HIGHLIGHT: Since the primary aim of this paper is to present a negative result, and the best counterexamples are the simplest ones, we restrict all discussions to finite (discrete) environments, ignoring issues of function approximation and limited sample size.

84, TITLE: Personalized Adversarial Data Augmentation for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: ZENGRUI JIN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In contrast to existing data augmentation techniques only modifying the speaking rate or overall shape of spectral contour, fine-grained spectro-temporal differences between dysarthric, elderly and normal speech are modelled using a novel set of speaker dependent (SD) generative adversarial networks (GAN) based data augmentation approaches in this paper.

85, TITLE: A Survey of Left Atrial Appendage Segmentation and Analysis in 3D and 4D Medical Images
AUTHORS: Hrvoje Leventi? ; Marin Ben?evi? ; Danilo Babin ; Marija Habijan ; Irena Gali?
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Several semi- and fully-automatic methods for segmenting the appendage have been proposed.

86, TITLE: Slimmable Video Codec
AUTHORS: ZHAOCHENG LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we propose a slimmable video codec (SlimVC), by integrating a slimmable temporal entropy model in a slimmable autoencoder.

87, TITLE: A Microstructure Estimation Transformer Inspired By Sparse Representation for Diffusion MRI
AUTHORS: TIANSHU ZHENG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Motivated by the superior performance of the Transformer, in this work, we present a learning-based framework based on Transformer, namely, a Microstructure Estimation Transformer with Sparse Coding (METSC) for dMRI-based microstructure estimation with downsampled q-space data.

88, TITLE: Joint Power Allocation and Beamformer for MmW-NOMA Downlink Systems By Deep Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Abbas Akbarpour-Kasgari ; Mehrdad Ardebilipour
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Joint power allocation and beamforming of mmW-NOMA systems is mandatory which could be met by optimization approaches. To this end, we have exploited Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach due to policy generation leading to an optimized sum-rate of users.
