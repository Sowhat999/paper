39, TITLE:      Do We Train on Test Data? Purging CIFAR of Near-Duplicates
http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00423
AUTHORS:        Björn Barz ; Joachim Denzler
COMMENTS:       Journal of Imaging
HIGHLIGHT:      The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are two of the most heavily benchmarked datasets in computer vision and are often used to evaluate novel methods and model architectures in the field of deep learning. To eliminate this bias, we provide the "fair CIFAR" (ciFAIR) dataset, where we replaced all duplicates in the test sets with new images sampled from the same domain.
