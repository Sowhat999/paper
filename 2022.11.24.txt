AUTHORS: Mateus Karvat Camara ; Adriana Postal ; Tomas Henrique Maul ; Gustavo Paetzold
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Even though it is easier to acquire data on low-stakes deception since it can be simulated (faked) in controlled settings, these lies do not hold the same significance or depth as genuine high-stakes lies, which are much harder to obtain and hold the practical interest of automated DD systems. To investigate whether this distinction holds true from a practical perspective, we design several experiments comparing a high-stakes DD dataset and a low-stakes DD dataset evaluating their results on a Deep Learning classifier working exclusively from video data.
