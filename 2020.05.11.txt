HIGHLIGHT:      This paper describes the implementation of a system to recognize employees and visitors wanting to gain access to a physical office through face images and speech-to-text recognition.

43, TITLE:      PO-EMO: Conceptualization, Annotation, and Modeling of Aesthetic Emotions in German and English Poetry
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07723
AUTHORS:        Thomas Haider ; Steffen Eger ; Evgeny Kim ; Roman Klinger ; Winfried Menninghaus
COMMENTS:       Emotion, Aesthetic Emotions, Literature, Poetry, Annotation, Corpora, Emotion Recognition, Multi-Label
HIGHLIGHT:      Most approaches to emotion analysis of social media, literature, news, and other domains focus exclusively on basic emotion categories as defined by Ekman or Plutchik.

44, TITLE:      MISA: Modality-Invariant and -Specific Representations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03545
AUTHORS:        Devamanyu Hazarika ; Roger Zimmermann ; Soujanya Poria
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we aim to learn effective modality representations to aid the process of fusion.

45, TITLE:      Enhancing Geometric Factors in Model Learning and Inference for Object Detection and Instance Segmentation

AUTHORS:        Zhaohui Zheng ; Ping Wang ; Dongwei Ren ; Wei Liu ; Rongguang Ye ; Qinghua Hu ; Wangmeng Zuo
COMMENTS:       All the source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Zzh-tju/CIoU arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1911.08287
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose Complete-IoU (CIoU) loss and Cluster-NMS for enhancing geometric factors in both bounding box regression and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), leading to notable gains of average precision (AP) and average recall (AR), without the sacrifice of inference efficiency.

46, TITLE:      Targeted Attack for Deep Hashing based Retrieval
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07955
AUTHORS:        Jiawang Bai ; Bin Chen ; Yiming Li ; Dongxian Wu ; Weiwei Guo ; Shu-tao Xia ; En-hui Yang
COMMENTS:       21 pages
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a novel method, dubbed deep hashing targeted attack (DHTA), to study the targeted attack on such retrieval.

47, TITLE:      Deep Learning for Image-based Automatic Dial Meter Reading: Dataset and Baselines
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03106
AUTHORS:        Gabriel Salomon ; Rayson Laroca ; David Menotti
COMMENTS:       Accepted for presentation at the 2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
HIGHLIGHT:      Our main contributions are: (i) a public real-world dial meter dataset (shared upon request) called UFPR-ADMR; (ii) a deep learning-based recognition baseline on the proposed dataset; and (iii) a detailed error analysis of the main issues present in AMR for dial meters.

48, TITLE:      DMCP: Differentiable Markov Channel Pruning for Neural Networks
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03354
AUTHORS:        Shaopeng Guo ; Yujie Wang ; Quanquan Li ; Junjie Yan
COMMENTS:       CVPR2020 Oral. Code has been released at https://github.com/zx55/dmcp
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable method for channel pruning, named Differentiable Markov Channel Pruning (DMCP), to efficiently search the optimal sub-structure.
