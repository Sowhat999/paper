AUTHORS: HUIMIN HUANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, there are mainly two challenges in a scale-wise perspective: (1) intra-scale problem: the existing methods lacked in extracting local-global cues in each scale, which may impact the signal propagation of small objects; (2) inter-scale problem: the existing methods failed to explore distinctive information from multiple scales, which may hinder the representation learning from objects with widely variable size, shape and location. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backbone, namely ScaleFormer, with two appealing designs: (1) A scale-wise intra-scale transformer is designed to couple the CNN-based local features with the transformer-based global cues in each scale, where the row-wise and column-wise global dependencies can be extracted by a lightweight Dual-Axis MSA.

91, TITLE: FCSN: Global Context Aware Segmentation By Learning The Fourier Coefficients of Objects in Medical Images
AUTHORS: Young Seok Jeon ; Hongfei Yang ; Mengling Feng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]

92, TITLE: Beyond CNNs: Exploiting Further Inherent Symmetries in Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: SHUCHAO PANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This is because, although the human visual system can detect symmetries in 2D images effectively, regular CNNs can only exploit translation invariance, overlooking further inherent symmetries existing in medical images such as rotations and reflections. To solve this problem, we propose a novel group equivariant segmentation framework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more precise representations.
