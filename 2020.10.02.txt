HIGHLIGHT:      Motivated by the stringent requirements of unstructured real-world where a plethora of unknown objects reside in arbitrary locations of the surface, we propose a voxel-based deep 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) that generates feasible 6-DoF grasp poses in unrestricted workspace with reachability awareness.

58, TITLE:      FocusLiteNN: High Efficiency Focus Quality Assessment for Digital Pathology
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06565
AUTHORS:        Zhongling Wang ; Mahdi S. Hosseini ; Adyn Miles ; Konstantinos N. Plataniotis ; Zhou Wang
COMMENTS:       To be published in the 23rd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2020
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:      Here, we propose a highly efficient CNN-based model that maintains fast computations similar to the knowledge-driven methods without excessive hardware requirements such as GPUs. We create a training dataset using FocusPath which encompasses diverse tissue slides across nine different stain colors, where the stain diversity greatly helps the model to learn diverse color spectrum and tissue structures. We introduce a novel comprehensive evaluation dataset, the largest of its kind, annotated and compiled from TCGA repository for model assessment and comparison, for which the proposed method exhibits superior precision-speed trade-off when compared with existing knowledge-driven and data-driven FQA approaches.
