81, TITLE: BiometryNet: Landmark-based Fetal Biometry Estimation from Standard Ultrasound Planes
AUTHORS: NETANELL AVISDRIS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, segmentation annotations are time-consuming and may be inaccurate, and landmark detection requires developing measurement-specific geometric methods. This paper describes BiometryNet, an end-to-end landmark regression framework for fetal biometry estimation that overcomes these limitations.
