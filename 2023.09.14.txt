AUTHORS: ZHENGUANG LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite its simplicity, this paradigm heavily relies on the original entangled features and lacks constraints guaranteeing that useful task-relevant semantics are extracted from the features. In this paper, we seek to tackle the above challenges from two aspects: (1) We propose to disentangle an original high-dimensional feature into multiple sub-features, explicitly disentangling the feature into exclusive lower-dimensional components.

114, TITLE: FedDIP: Federated Learning with Extreme Dynamic Pruning and Incremental Regularization
AUTHORS: Qianyu Long ; Christos Anagnostopoulos ; Shameem Puthiya Parambath ; Daning Bi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC, H.4; I.2]
HIGHLIGHT: Although recent DNN compression methods (e.g., sparsification, pruning) tackle such challenges, they do not holistically consider an adaptively controlled reduction of parameter exchange while maintaining high accuracy levels. We, therefore, contribute with a novel FL framework (coined FedDIP), which combines (i) dynamic model pruning with error feedback to eliminate redundant information exchange, which contributes to significant performance improvement, with (ii) incremental regularization that can achieve \textit{extreme} sparsity of models.

We instead propose a new paradigm that views the large-scale training of neural representations as a part of a partially-observed neural process framework, and leverage neural process algorithms to solve this task.
