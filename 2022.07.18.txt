HIGHLIGHT: However, for the transition of DL-based denoising to clinical practice, these data-driven approaches must generalize robustly beyond the seen training data. We, therefore, propose a hybrid denoising approach consisting of a set of trainable joint bilateral filters (JBFs) combined with a convolutional DL-based denoising network to predict the guidance image.

HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we leverage the clinical knowledge of how radiologists diagnose brain tumors from multiple MRI modalities and propose a clinical knowledge-driven brain tumor segmentation model, called CKD-TransBTS.
