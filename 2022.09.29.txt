90, TITLE: PCB-RandNet: Rethinking Random Sampling for LIDAR Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving Scene
AUTHORS: Huixian Cheng ; XianFeng Han ; Hang Jiang ; Dehong He ; Guoqiang Xiao
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, our quantative and qualitative studies have found that Random Sampling may be less suitable for the autonomous driving scenario, since the LiDAR points follow an uneven or even long-tailed distribution across the space, which prevents the model from capturing sufficient information from points in different distance ranges and reduces the model's learning capability. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new Polar Cylinder Balanced Random Sampling method that enables the downsampled point clouds to maintain a more balanced distribution and improve the segmentation performance under different spatial distributions.

106, TITLE: Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning Via Neighborhood Ranking
AUTHORS: ZHIYUAN NING et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While achieving promising performances, current GCL methods still suffer from two limitations: (1) uncontrollable validity of augmentation, that graph perturbation may produce invalid views against semantics and feature-topology correspondence of graph data; and (2) unreliable binary contrastive justification, that the positiveness and negativeness of the constructed views are difficult to be determined for non-euclidean graph data. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a new contrastive learning paradigm for graphs, namely Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning (GSCL), that conducts contrastive learning in a finer-granularity via ranking neighborhoods without any augmentations and binary contrastive justification.
