80, TITLE: Don't Lie to Me: Avoiding Malicious Explanations with STEALTH
AUTHORS: Lauren Alvarez ; Tim Menzies
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CR]
HIGHLIGHT: After recursively bi-clustering the data, STEALTH system asks the AI model a limited number of queries about class labels. STEALTH asks so few queries (1 per data cluster) that malicious algorithms (a) cannot detect its operation, nor (b) know when to lie.

81, TITLE: Separate And Diffuse: Using A Pretrained Diffusion Model for Improving Source Separation
AUTHORS: Shahar Lutati ; Eliya Nachmani ; Lior Wolf
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We show how the upper bound can be generalized to the case of random generative models.

82, TITLE: Rate-Perception Optimized Preprocessing for Video Coding
AUTHORS: CHENGQIAN MA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a rate-perception optimized preprocessing (RPP) method.

83, TITLE: Ultra-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Ultrasound Imaging
AUTHORS: MAGDALENA WYSOCKI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a physics-enhanced implicit neural representation (INR) for ultrasound (US) imaging that learns tissue properties from overlapping US sweeps.

84, TITLE: Data Consistent Deep Rigid MRI Motion Correction
AUTHORS: NALINI M. SINGH et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we use a deep network to reduce the joint image-motion parameter search to a search over rigid motion parameters alone.

85, TITLE: Self-Supervised Curricular Deep Learning for Chest X-Ray Image Classification
AUTHORS: Iván de Andrés Tamé ; Kirill Sirotkin ; Pablo Carballeira ; Marcos Escudero-Viñolo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we investigate the benefits of a curricular Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) pretraining scheme with respect to fully-supervised training regimes for pneumonia recognition on Chest X-Ray images of Covid-19 patients.
