CATEGORY:       cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT:      To avoid the labor-intensive process of summary soliciting, we propose the {\it reconstruction} strategy, which extracts segment summaries in an unsupervised manner by selecting its most informative part to reconstruct the segment.The proposed generation system comes with the following merits: (1) the summary provides high-level guidances for text generation and avoids the local minimum of individual word predictions; (2) the high-level discourse dependencies are captured in the conditional dependencies between summaries and are preserved during the summary expansion process and (3) additionally, we are able to consider significantly more contexts by representing contexts as concise summaries.
