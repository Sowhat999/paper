http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09065
AUTHORS:        Alexander Nettekoven ; Scott Fish ; Joseph Beaman ; Ufuk Topcu
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      To address these limitations, we study over 30 segmentation algorithms that segment each infrared image into a foreground and background.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09041
AUTHORS:        Charley Gros ; Andreanne Lemay ; Julien Cohen-Adad
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce SoftSeg, a deep learning training approach that takes advantage of soft ground truth labels, and is not bound to binary predictions.
