AUTHORS: Binxu Wang ; John J. Vastola
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.GR, cs.NE, F.2.2; I.3.3; I.2.10; I.2.6]
HIGHLIGHT: The corresponding reverse diffusion process can be modeled by dynamics on a (time-dependent) high-dimensional landscape full of Gaussian-like modes, which makes the following predictions: (i) individual trajectories tend to be very low-dimensional; (ii) scene elements that vary more within training data tend to emerge earlier; and (iii) early perturbations substantially change image content more often than late perturbations. We show that the behavior of a variety of trained unconditional and conditional diffusion models like Stable Diffusion is consistent with these predictions.

AUTHORS: DIEGO MONTES et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Among the top 10 discrepancies, we find differences of 1.23%-2.62% in accuracy and 9%-131% in latency.

244, TITLE: A General Framework for Learning Procedural Audio Models of Environmental Sounds
AUTHORS: Danzel Serrano ; Mark Cartwright
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces the Procedural (audio) Variational autoEncoder (ProVE) framework as a general approach to learning Procedural Audio PA models of environmental sounds with an improvement to the realism of the synthesis while maintaining provision of control over the generated sound through adjustable parameters.

245, TITLE: Some D-finite and Some Possibly D-finite Sequences in The OEIS
AUTHORS: Manuel Kauers ; Christoph Koutschan
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, math.CO]
HIGHLIGHT: In an automatic search, we found conjectural recurrences for some sequences in the OEIS that were not previously recognized as being D-finite.

246, TITLE: Enhancing Activity Prediction Models in Drug Discovery with The Ability to Understand Human Language
AUTHORS: Philipp Seidl ; Andreu Vall ; Sepp Hochreiter ; Günter Klambauer
CATEGORY: q-bio.BM [q-bio.BM, cs.CL, cs.LG, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we envision a novel type of activity prediction model that is able to adapt to new prediction tasks at inference time, via understanding textual information describing the task.

247, TITLE: Certified Robust Neural Networks: Generalization and Corruption Resistance
AUTHORS: Amine Bennouna ; Ryan Lucas ; Bart Van Parys
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Surprisingly, overfitting is a major concern in adversarial training of neural networks despite being mostly absent in standard training. We provide here theoretical evidence for this peculiar ``robust overfitting'' phenomenon.

248, TITLE: Fixed-point Quantization Aware Training for On-device Keyword-spotting
AUTHORS: SASHANK MACHA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel method to train and obtain FXP convolutional keyword-spotting (KWS) models.

249, TITLE: Learned Lossless Compression for JPEG Via Frequency-Domain Prediction
AUTHORS: JIXIANG LUO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learned lossless compression of JPEG images that achieves end-to-end optimized prediction of the distribution of decoded DCT coefficients.

250, TITLE: SurfNN: Joint Reconstruction of Multiple Cortical Surfaces from Magnetic Resonance Images
AUTHORS: Hao Zheng ; Hongming Li ; Yong Fan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To achieve fast, robust, and accurate reconstruction of the human cortical surfaces from 3D magnetic resonance images (MRIs), we develop a novel deep learning-based framework, referred to as SurfNN, to reconstruct simultaneously both inner (between white matter and gray matter) and outer (pial) surfaces from MRIs.

251, TITLE: Automated Peripancreatic Vessel Segmentation and Labeling Based on Iterative Trunk Growth and Weakly Supervised Mechanism
AUTHORS: LIWEN ZOU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Besides, unsupervised labeling algorithms cannot deal with complex anatomical variation while fully supervised methods require a large number of voxel-wise annotations for training, which is very labor-intensive and time-consuming.

252, TITLE: Robust Autoencoders for Collective Corruption Removal
AUTHORS: Taihui Li ; Hengkang Wang ; Peng Le ; XianE Tang ; Ju Sun
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose $\ell_1$- and scaling-invariant $\ell_1/\ell_2$-robust autoencoders based on a surprisingly compact formulation built on the intuition that deep autoencoders perform manifold learning.

253, TITLE: Audio-Visual Quality Assessment for User Generated Content: Database and Method
AUTHORS: Yuqin Cao ; Xiongkuo Min ; Wei Sun ; Xiaoping Zhang ; Guangtao Zhai
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we conduct the first study to address the problem of UGC audio and video quality assessment (AVQA).

254, TITLE: Detection of The Arterial Input Function Using DSC-MRI Data
AUTHORS: Svitlana Alkhimova ; Kateryna Sazonova
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study provides an overview of the current state of the field of arterial input function detection.
