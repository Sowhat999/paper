23, TITLE: Contrastive Semantic-Guided Image Smoothing Network
AUTHORS: JIE WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, current methods neglect two important facts in smoothing: 1) naive pixel-level regression supervised by the limited number of high-quality smoothing ground-truth could lead to domain shift and cause generalization problems towards real-world images; 2) texture appearance is closely related to object semantics, so that image smoothing requires awareness of semantic difference to apply adaptive smoothing strengths. To address these issues, we propose a novel Contrastive Semantic-Guided Image Smoothing Network (CSGIS-Net) that combines both contrastive prior and semantic prior to facilitate robust image smoothing.
