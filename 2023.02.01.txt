1, TITLE: Near-perfect Reachability of Variational Quantum Search with Depth-1 Ansatz
AUTHORS: Junpeng Zhan
CATEGORY: quant-ph [quant-ph, cs.CC, math.QA]

We prove that the VQS, with a single layer of Ry gates as its Ansatz, has near-perfect reachability in finding the good element of an arbitrarily large unstructured data set, and its reachability exponentially improves with the number of qubits, where the reachability is defined to quantify the ability of a given Ansatz to generate an optimal quantum state.

106, TITLE: Execution-based Code Generation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Parshin Shojaee ; Aneesh Jain ; Sindhu Tipirneni ; Chandan K. Reddy
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.PL]

To address this limitation, we propose PPOCoder, a new framework for code generation that combines pretrained PL models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) deep reinforcement learning and employs execution feedback as the external source of knowledge into the model optimization.

AUTHORS: Alexander Nikulin ; Vladislav Kurenkov ; Denis Tarasov ; Sergey Kolesnikov
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the success of Random Network Distillation (RND) in various domains, it was shown as not discriminative enough to be used as an uncertainty estimator for penalizing out-of-distribution actions in offline reinforcement learning. In this paper, we revisit these results and show that, with a naive choice of conditioning for the RND prior, it becomes infeasible for the actor to effectively minimize the anti-exploration bonus and discriminativity is not an issue.
