94, TITLE: Quantum Advantage for All
AUTHORS: Christoph M. Kirsch ; Stefanie Muroya Lei
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We show how to translate a subset of RISC-V machine code compiled from a subset of C to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models that can be solved by a quantum annealing machine: given a bound $n$, there is input $I$ to a program $P$ such that $P$ runs into a given program state $E$ executing no more than $n$ machine instructions if and only if the QUBO model of $P$ for $n$ evaluates to 0 on $I$.

AUTHORS: Emanuele De Angelis ; Fabio Fioravanti ; Alberto Pettorossi ; Maurizio Proietti
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.LO]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a new technique for transforming CHCs defined on ADTs into CHCs where the arguments of the predicates have only basic types, such as integers and booleans.

96, TITLE: VISTA 2.0: An Open, Data-driven Simulator for Multimodal Sensing and Policy Learning for Autonomous Vehicles

98, TITLE: Upsampling Layers for Music Source Separation
AUTHORS: JORDI PONS et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we investigate the practical implications of having upsampling artifacts in the resulting audio, by studying how different artifacts interact and assessing their impact on the models' performance.

99, TITLE: Guided-TTS:Text-to-Speech with Untranscribed Speech
AUTHORS: Heeseung Kim ; Sungwon Kim ; Sungroh Yoon
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we present Guided-TTS, a high-quality TTS model that learns to generate speech from untranscribed speech data.

100, TITLE: A Free Lunch from The Noise: Provable and Practical Exploration for Representation Learning
AUTHORS: Tongzheng Ren ; Tianjun Zhang ; Csaba Szepesvári ; Bo Dai
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Based on this observation, we propose Spectral Dynamics Embedding (SPEDE), which breaks the trade-off and completes optimistic exploration for representation learning by exploiting the structure of the noise.

101, TITLE: SpeechMoE2: Mixture-of-Experts Model with Improved Routing
AUTHORS: Zhao You ; Shulin Feng ; Dan Su ; Dong Yu
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: To further improve speech recognition performance against varying domains and accents, we propose a new router architecture which integrates additional global domain and accent embedding into router input to promote adaptability.

AUTHORS: Xingzheng Lyu ; Li Cheng ; Sanyuan Zhang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we construct a novel benchmark RETA with 81 labeled vessel masks aiming to facilitate retinal vessel analysis.

104, TITLE: RadFusion: Benchmarking Performance and Fairness for Multimodal Pulmonary Embolism Detection from CT and EHR
AUTHORS: YUYIN ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To better assess these challenges, we present RadFusion, a multimodal, benchmark dataset of 1794 patients with corresponding EHR data and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans labeled for pulmonary embolism.

105, TITLE: Is Deep Image Prior in Need of A Good Education?
AUTHORS: RICCARDO BARBANO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Our work develops a two-stage learning paradigm to address the computational challenge: (i) we perform a supervised pretraining of the network on a synthetic dataset; (ii) we fine-tune the network's parameters to adapt to the target reconstruction.
