163, TITLE:	A Generalized Forecasting Solution to Enable Future Insights of COVID-19 at Sub-national Level Resolutions
AUTHORS:	UMAR MARIKKAR et. al.
CATEGORY:	stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.AI, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this study, a forecasting solution is proposed, to predict daily new
 cases of COVID-19 in regions small enough where containment measures 
could be locally implemented, by targeting three main shortcomings that 
exist in literature; the unreliability of existing data caused by 
inconsistent testing patterns in smaller regions, weak deploy-ability of
 forecasting models towards predicting cases in previously unseen 
regions, and model training biases caused by the imbalanced nature of 
data in COVID-19 epi-curves.
