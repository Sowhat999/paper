HIGHLIGHT: Hence, we developed a Quran semantic search tool which finds the verses pertaining to the user inquiry or prompt. To achieve this, we trained several models on a large dataset of over 30 tafsirs, where typically each tafsir corresponds to one verse in the Quran and, using cosine similarity, obtained the tafsir tensor which is most similar to the prompt tensor of interest, which was then used to index for the corresponding ayah in the Quran.
