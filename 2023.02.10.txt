Our approach explicitly seeks the middle ground, enabling the human designer to specify a vast but meaningful proto-goal space, and an autonomous discovery process to refine this to a narrower space of controllable, reachable, novel, and relevant goals.

130, TITLE: Trading Information Between Latents in Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders
AUTHORS: Tim Z. Xiao ; Robert Bamler
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.IT, cs.LG, math.IT]
HIGHLIGHT: The proposal of $\beta$-VAEs (Higgins et al., 2017) breaks this interpretation and generalizes VAEs to application domains beyond generative modeling (e.g., representation learning, clustering, or lossy data compression) by introducing an objective function that allows practitioners to trade off between the information content ("bit rate") of the latent representation and the distortion of reconstructed data (Alemi et al., 2018). In this paper, we reconsider this rate/distortion trade-off in the context of hierarchical VAEs, i.e., VAEs with more than one layer of latent variables.
