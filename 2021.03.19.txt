97, TITLE: Zooid: A DSL for Certified Multiparty Computation
AUTHORS: David Castro-Perez ; Francisco Ferreira ; Lorenzo Gheri ; Nobuko Yoshida
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]

98, TITLE: RP-VIO: Robust Plane-based Visual-Inertial Odometry for Dynamic Environments
AUTHORS: Karnik Ram ; Chaitanya Kharyal ; Sudarshan S. Harithas ; K. Madhava Krishna
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present RP-VIO, a monocular visual-inertial odometry system that leverages the simple geometry of these planes for improved robustness and accuracy in challenging dynamic environments. Since existing datasets have a limited number of dynamic elements, we also present a highly-dynamic, photorealistic synthetic dataset for a more effective evaluation of the capabilities of modern VINS systems.

AUTHORS: Andrew N Carr ; Quentin Berthet ; Mathieu Blondel ; Olivier Teboul ; Neil Zeghidour
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we advance self-supervised learning from permutations, by pre-training a model to reorder shuffled parts of the spectrogram of an audio signal, to improve downstream classification performance.

101, TITLE: PySTACHIO: Python Single-molecule TrAcking StoiCHiometry Intensity and SimulatiOn, A Flexible, Extensible, Beginner-friendly and Optimized Program for Analysis of Single-molecule Microscopy Data

CATEGORY: q-bio.BM [q-bio.BM, cs.PL, physics.bio-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we present our recent efforts to redevelop our quantitative single-molecule analysis routines into an optimized and extensible Python program, with both GUI and command-line implementations to facilitate its use on both local machines and remote clusters, and by beginners and advanced users alike.

102, TITLE: Phylogenetic Typology
AUTHORS: Gerhard Jäger ; Johannes Wahle
CATEGORY: q-bio.PE [q-bio.PE, cs.CL, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: In this article we propose a novel method to estimate the frequency distribution of linguistic variables while controlling for statistical non-independence due to shared ancestry.
