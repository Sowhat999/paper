CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although simpler and computationally efficient pretraining objectives, e.g., predicting the first character of a masked token, have recently shown comparable results to MLM, no objectives with a masking scheme actually outperform it in downstream tasks. Motivated by the assumption that their lack of complexity plays a vital role in the degradation, we validate whether more complex masked objectives can achieve better results and investigate how much complexity they should have to perform comparably to MLM.

AUTHORS: Kai Zhang ; Bernal JimÃ©nez GutiÃ©rrez ; Yu Su

To address this limitation, we propose QA4RE, a framework that aligns RE with question answering (QA), a predominant task in instruction-tuning datasets.
