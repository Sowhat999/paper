250, TITLE: A Localization-to-Segmentation Framework for Automatic Tumor Segmentation in Whole-Body PET/CT Images
AUTHORS: Linghan Cai ; Jianhao Huang ; Zihang Zhu ; Jinpeng Lu ; Yongbing Zhang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, precise tumor segmentation is challenging due to the small size of many tumors and the similarity of high-uptake normal areas to the tumor regions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a localization-to-segmentation framework (L2SNet) for precise tumor segmentation.

251, TITLE: AutoFuse: Automatic Fusion Networks for Deformable Medical Image Registration
AUTHORS: Mingyuan Meng ; Michael Fulham ; Dagan Feng ; Lei Bi ; Jinman Kim

252, TITLE: SSHNN: Semi-Supervised Hybrid NAS Network for Echocardiographic Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: RENQI CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Compared with manual design, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) realizes better segmentation results due to larger search space and automatic optimization, but most of the existing methods are weak in layer-wise feature aggregation and adopt a ``strong encoder, weak decoder" structure, insufficient to handle global relationships and local details. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised hybrid NAS network for accurate medical image segmentation termed SSHNN.
