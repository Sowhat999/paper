HIGHLIGHT: Streaming recognition and segmentation of multi-party conversations with overlapping speech is crucial for the next generation of voice assistant applications. In this work we address its challenges discovered in the previous work on multi-turn recurrent neural network transducer (MT-RNN-T) with a novel approach, separator-transducer-segmenter (STS), that enables tighter integration of speech separation, recognition and segmentation in a single model.

85, TITLE: End-to-End Multi-Person Audio/Visual Automatic Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: Otavio Braga ; Takaki Makino ; Olivier Siohan ; Hank Liao
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a fully differentiable A/V ASR model that is able to handle multiple face tracks in a video.

86, TITLE: Best of Both Worlds: Multi-task Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition and Active Speaker Detection
AUTHORS: Otavio Braga ; Olivier Siohan
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent work has shown that we can solve both problems simultaneously by employing an attention mechanism over the competing video tracks of the speakers' faces, at the cost of sacrificing some accuracy on active speaker detection. This work closes this gap in active speaker detection accuracy by presenting a single model that can be jointly trained with a multi-task loss.

AUTHORS: Jiachen Lian ; Chunlei Zhang ; Gopala Krishna Anumanchipalli ; Dong Yu
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we continue the direction by raising one concern about the prior distribution of content branch in the DSVAE baseline.

AUTHORS: NIMA HATAMI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, a multimodal convolutional neural network - long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) based ensemble model is proposed.
