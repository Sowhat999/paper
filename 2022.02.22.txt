179, TITLE: Speaker Adaptation Using Spectro-Temporal Deep Features for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: MENGZHE GENG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SD, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: Motivated by the spectro-temporal level differences between dysarthric, elderly and normal speech that systematically manifest in articulatory imprecision, decreased volume and clarity, slower speaking rates and increased dysfluencies, novel spectrotemporal subspace basis deep embedding features derived using SVD speech spectrum decomposition are proposed in this paper to facilitate auxiliary feature based speaker adaptation of state-of-the-art hybrid DNN/TDNN and end-to-end Conformer speech recognition systems.

AUTHORS: SHAHEER U. SAEED et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose an extension to this task-specific IQA approach, by adding a task-agnostic IQA based on auto-encoding as the target task.

186, TITLE: The Loop Game: Quality Assessment and Optimization for Low-Light Image Enhancement
AUTHORS: BAOLIANG CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
