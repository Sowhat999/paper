96, TITLE: On The Complexity of Rational Verification
AUTHORS: Julian Gutierrez ; Muhammad Najib ; Giuseppe Perelli ; Michael Wooldridge
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT: Rational verification can be understood as a counterpart to model checking for multiagent systems, but while classical model checking can be done in polynomial time for some temporal logic specification languages such as CTL, and polynomial space with LTL specifications, rational verification is much harder: the key decision problems for rational verification are 2EXPTIME-complete with LTL specifications, even when using explicit-state system representations. Against this background, our contributions in this paper are threefold.
