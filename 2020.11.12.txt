108, TITLE:     Distorted Image Restoration Using Stacked Adversarial Network
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05784
AUTHORS:        Yi Gu ; Yuting Gao ; Jie Li ; Chentao Wu ; Weijia Jia
COMMENTS:       Distorted Image Restoration, Liquify, Benchmark, Adversarial Framework
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      Unlike existing methods mainly designed for specific single deformation, this paper aims at automatic distorted image restoration, which is characterized by seeking the appropriate warping of multitype and multi-scale distorted images.

109, TITLE:     A Unified Framework For Compressive Video Recovery From Coded Exposure Techniques
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05532
AUTHORS:        Prasan Shedligeri ; Anupama S ; Kaushik Mitra
COMMENTS:       10 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables. Accepted to be published at WACV 2021
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      Here, we propose a unified learning-based framework to make such a qualitative and quantitative comparison between those which capture only a single coded image (Flutter Shutter, Pixel-wise coded exposure) and those that capture two measurements per exposure (C2B).

CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a pipeline for automatic classification of gliomas into three sub-types: oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, and glioblastoma, using both radiology and histopathology images.
