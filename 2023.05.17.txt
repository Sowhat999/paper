To tackle this problem, we propose a Hybrid and Collaborative Passage Reranking (HybRank) method, which leverages the substantial similarity measurements of upstream retrievers for passage collaboration and incorporates the lexical and semantic properties of sparse and dense retrievers for reranking.

AUTHORS: Shengchao Hu ; Li Shen ; Ya Zhang ; Dacheng Tao
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Additionally, directly extending prompt-tuning approaches to RL is challenging because RL prompts guide agent behavior based on environmental modeling and analysis, rather than filling in missing information, making it unlikely that adjustments to the prompt format for downstream tasks, as in NLP, can yield significant improvements. In this work, we propose the Prompt-Tuning DT algorithm to address these challenges by using trajectory segments as prompts to guide RL agents in acquiring environmental information and optimizing prompts via black-box tuning to enhance their ability to contain more relevant information, thereby enabling agents to make better decisions.

From this view, we propose a general framework for deriving intrinsic rewards -- Masked Input Modeling for Exploration (MIMEx) -- where the mask distribution can be flexibly tuned to control the difficulty of the underlying conditional prediction task.

HIGHLIGHT: Examples include but are not limited to algorithms for brain anatomy parcellation, tissue segmentation, and brain extraction. To solve this dilemma, we introduce the BraTS 2023 inpainting challenge.

161, TITLE: EEG-based Sleep Staging with Hybrid Attention
AUTHORS: Xinliang Zhou ; Chenyu Liu ; Jiaping Xiao ; Yang Liu
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the Hybrid Attention EEG Sleep Staging (HASS) Framework.

162, TITLE: Unsupervised Sequence-to-sequence Learning for Automatic Signal Quality Assessment in Multi-channel Electrical Impedance-based Hemodynamic Monitoring
AUTHORS: Chang Min Hyun ; Tae-Geun Kim ; Kyounghun Lee
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: This study proposes an unsupervised sequence-to-sequence learning approach that automatically assesses the motion-induced reliability degradation of the cardiac volume signal (CVS) in multi-channel electrical impedance-based hemodynamic monitoring.
