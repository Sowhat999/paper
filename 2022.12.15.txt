HIGHLIGHT: We evaluate our method on a broad range of experiments with the focus on generalization on unseen objects, unseen tasks, unseen environments, and sim-to-real transfer.

88, TITLE: Enabling The Wireless Metaverse Via Semantic Multiverse Communication
AUTHORS: Jihong Park ; Jinho Choi ; Seong-Lyun Kim ; Mehdi Bennis
CATEGORY: cs.NI [cs.NI, cs.AI, cs.IT, cs.LG, math.IT]
HIGHLIGHT: Metaverse over wireless networks is an emerging use case of the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, posing unprecedented challenges in terms of its multi-modal data transmissions with stringent latency and reliability requirements. Towards enabling this wireless metaverse, in this article we propose a novel semantic communication (SC) framework by decomposing the metaverse into human/machine agent-specific semantic multiverses (SMs).

89, TITLE: Are Metaheuristics Worth It? A Computational Comparison Between Nature-inspired and Deterministic Techniques on Black-box Optimization Problems
AUTHORS: Jakub Kudela
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, math.OC]
HIGHLIGHT: In the field of derivative-free optimization, both of its main branches, the deterministic and nature-inspired techniques, experienced in recent years substantial advancement. In this paper, we provide an extensive computational comparison of selected methods from each of these branches.

90, TITLE: Category-Graded Algebraic Theories and Effect Handlers
AUTHORS: Takahiro Sanada
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We provide an effect system CatEff based on a category-graded extension of algebraic theories that correspond to category-graded monads.

91, TITLE: Affine Monads and Lazy Structures for Bayesian Programming
AUTHORS: Swaraj Dash ; Younesse Kaddar ; Hugo Paquet ; Sam Staton
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that the separation is important from a decidability perspective, and that the recent model of quasi-Borel spaces supports these two monads. To perform Bayesian inference with these examples, we introduce new inference methods that are specially adapted to laziness; they are proven correct by reference to the Metropolis-Hastings-Green method.

92, TITLE: PSTMonitor: Monitor Synthesis from Probabilistic Session Types
AUTHORS: Christian Bartolo Burlò ; Adrian Francalanza ; Alceste Scalas ; Catia Trubiani ; Emilio Tuosto
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We present PSTMonitor, a tool for the run-time verification of quantitative specifications of message-passing applications, based on probabilistic session types.

93, TITLE: Verifying Term Graph Optimizations Using Isabelle/HOL
AUTHORS: Brae J. Webb ; Ian J. Hayes ; Mark Utting
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.LO]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we explore an approach to using term rewrites to verify term graph transformations of optimizations within the GraalVM compiler.

94, TITLE: API-Spector: An API-to-API Specification Recommendation Engine
AUTHORS: Sae Young Moon ; Fran Silavong ; Sean Moran
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: API-Spector presents several significant contributions, including: (1) novel methods of processing and extracting key information from OpenAPI specifications, (2) innovative feature extraction techniques that are optimized for the highly technical API specification domain, and (3) a novel log-linear probabilistic model that combines multiple signals to retrieve relevant and high quality OpenAPI specification components given a query specification.

95, TITLE: Disentangling Prosody Representations with Unsupervised Speech Reconstruction
AUTHORS: LEYUAN QU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: The aim of this paper is to address the disentanglement of emotional prosody from speech based on unsupervised reconstruction.

96, TITLE: CLIPSep: Learning Text-queried Sound Separation with Noisy Unlabeled Videos
AUTHORS: Hao-Wen Dong ; Naoya Takahashi ; Yuki Mitsufuji ; Julian McAuley ; Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we aim to approach text-queried universal sound separation by using only unlabeled data.

97, TITLE: Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Retinal Imaging for The Detection of Systemic Diseases
AUTHORS: Ayushi Raj Bhatt ; Rajkumar Vaghashiya ; Meghna Kulkarni ; Dr Prakash Kamaraj
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Many current CNN-based deep neural networks used for diagnosing retinal disorders might have appreciable performance but fail to pinpoint the basis driving their decisions. To improve these decisions' transparency, we have proposed a clinician-in-the-loop assisted intelligent workflow that performs a retinal vascular assessment on the fundus images to derive quantifiable and descriptive parameters.

98, TITLE: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Automated Knee Osteoarthritis Phenotype Classification
AUTHORS: JUNRU ZHONG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Purpose: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in automated knee osteoarthritis (OA) phenotype classification using a small dataset (n=50).

99, TITLE: M-GenSeg: Domain Adaptation For Target Modality Tumor Segmentation With Annotation-Efficient Supervision
AUTHORS: Malo Alefsen de Boisredon d'Assier ; Eugene Vorontsov ; Samuel Kadoury
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This shortcoming, amplified by the limited availability of annotated data, has been hampering the deployment of such methods at a larger scale across modalities. To address these issues, we propose M-GenSeg, a new semi-supervised training strategy for accurate cross-modality tumor segmentation on unpaired bi-modal datasets.
