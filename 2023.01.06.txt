To amend this, we propose a novel TW-BERT to learn Trajectory-Word alignment for solving video-language tasks.

HIGHLIGHT: Crucially, motion planning and control algorithms require a stream of accurate joint angle data provided by joint encoders, the failure of which may result in an unrecoverable loss of functionality. In this paper, we present a novel method for retrieving the joint angles of a robot manipulator using only a single RGB image of its current configuration, opening up an avenue for recovering system functionality when conventional proprioceptive sensing is unavailable.

83, TITLE: An Automatic Method for Generating Symbolic Expressions of Zernike Circular Polynomials
AUTHORS: Hong-Yan Zhang ; Yu Zhou ; Fu-Yun Li
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, cs.MS]
HIGHLIGHT: An automatic method for generating symbolic expressions for ZCP is proposed based on five essential factors: the new theorems for converting the single/double indices of the ZCP, the robust and effective numeric algorithms for computing key parameters of ZCP, the symbolic algorithms for generating mathematical expressions of ZCP, and meta-programming \& \LaTeX{} programming for generating the table of ZCP.

84, TITLE: Competitive Learning to Generate Sparse Representations for Associative Memory
AUTHORS: Luis Sacouto ; Andreas Wichert
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a biologically plausible network that encodes images into codes that are suitable for associative memory.

85, TITLE: Bayesian Weapon System Reliability Modeling with Cox-Weibull Neural Network
AUTHORS: Michael Potter ; Benny Cheng
CATEGORY: stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.PR]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose to integrate weapon system features (such as weapon system manufacturer, deployment time and location, storage time and location, etc.) into a parameterized Cox-Weibull reliability model via a neural network, like DeepSurv, to improve predictive maintenance.

86, TITLE: Fully Automated Artery-Vein Ratio and Vascular Tortuosity Measurement in Retinal Fundus Images
AUTHORS: Aashis Khanal ; Rolando Estrada
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing techniques tend to only work on the partial region, but we extract the complete vascular structure. We have shown the usability of this topology by extracting two of the most important vascular features; Artery-Vein ratio, and vessel tortuosity.

87, TITLE: Enabling Augmented Segmentation and Registration in Ultrasound-Guided Spinal Surgery Via Realistic Ultrasound Synthesis from Diagnostic CT Volume
AUTHORS: Ang Li ; Jiayi Han ; Yongjian Zhao ; Keyu Li ; Li Liu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper aims to tackle the issues on unavailable or insufficient clinical US data and meaningful annotation to enable bone segmentation and registration for US-guided spinal surgery.

88, TITLE: MedKLIP: Medical Knowledge Enhanced Language-Image Pre-Training
AUTHORS: Chaoyi Wu ; Xiaoman Zhang ; Ya Zhang ; Yanfeng Wang ; Weidi Xie
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CL, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we consider the problem of enhancing self-supervised visual-language pre-training (VLP) with medical-specific knowledge, by exploiting the paired image-text reports from the radiological daily practice.

89, TITLE: TractGraphCNN: Anatomically Informed Graph CNN for Classification Using Diffusion MRI Tractography
AUTHORS: YUQIAN CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose TractGraphCNN, a novel, anatomically informed graph CNN framework for machine learning tasks using diffusion MRI tractography.
