AUTHORS:        Jun Ma ; Yixin Wang ; Xingle An ; Cheng Ge ; Ziqi Yu ; Jianan Chen ; Qiongjie Zhu ; Guoqiang Dong ; Jian He ; Zhiqiang He ; Ziwei Nie ; Xiaoping Yang
COMMENTS:       7 pages
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we created a COVID-19 3D CT dataset with 20 cases that contains 1800+ annotated slices and made it publicly available. To promote the development of annotation-efficient deep learning methods, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation that contain current main research interests, e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the largest public annotated COVID-19 CT volume dataset, the first segmentation benchmark, and the most pre-trained models up to now.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12770
AUTHORS:        Cristobal Eyzaguirre ; Alvaro Soto
COMMENTS:       CVPR 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      This paper presents a novel attention-based algorithm for achieving adaptive computation called DACT, which, unlike existing ones, is end-to-end differentiable.Our method can be used in conjunction with many networks; in particular, we study its application to the widely know MAC architecture, obtaining a significant reduction in the number of recurrent steps needed to achieve similar accuracies, therefore improving its performance to computation ratio.Furthermore, we show that by increasing the maximum number of steps used, we surpass the accuracy of even our best non-adaptive MAC in the CLEVR dataset, demonstrating that our approach is able to control the number of steps without significant loss of performance.Additional advantages provided by our approach include considerably improving interpretability by discarding useless steps and providing more insights into the underlying reasoning process.Finally, we present adaptive computation as an equivalent to an ensemble of models, similar to a mixture of expert formulation.Both the code and the configuration files for our experiments are made available to support further research in this area.
