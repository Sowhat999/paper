http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02904
AUTHORS:        Robert Dickerson ; Qianchuan Ye ; Benjamin Delaware
HIGHLIGHT:      This paper proposes a flexible way to underapproximate the behaviors of nondeterministic choices so that clients can soundly reason about the existence of desirable behaviors, while at the same time permitting some freedom in how those choices are implemented.

103, TITLE:     A Unified End-to-End Framework for Efficient Deep Image Compression
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03370
AUTHORS:        Jiaheng Liu ; Guo Lu ; Zhihao Hu ; Dong Xu
COMMENTS:       We will released our code and training data
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a unified framework called Efficient Deep Image Compression (EDIC) based on three new technologies, including a channel attention module, a Gaussian mixture model and a decoder-side enhancement module.

104, TITLE:     Conversational Question Answering over Passages by Leveraging Word Proximity Networks
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13117
AUTHORS:        Magdalena Kaiser ; Rishiraj Saha Roy ; Gerhard Weikum
COMMENTS:       SIGIR 2020 Demonstrations
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we demonstrate CROWN (Conversational passage ranking by Reasoning Over Word Networks): an unsupervised yet effective system for conversational QA with passage responses, that supports several modes of context propagation over multiple turns.

105, TITLE:     Causality-based Explanation of Classification Outcomes
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06868
AUTHORS:        Leopoldo Bertossi ; Jordan Li ; Maximilian Schleich ; Dan Suciu ; Zografoula Vagena
COMMENTS:       16 pages, 6 figures, 1 table
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a simple definition of an explanation for the outcome of a classifier based on concepts from causality.

106, TITLE:     Proving P!=NP in first-order PA
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10080
AUTHORS:        Rupert McCallum
HIGHLIGHT:      We show that it is provable in PA that there is an arithmetically definable sequence $\{\phi_{n}:n \in \omega\}$ of $\Pi^{0}_{2}$-sentences, such that - PRA+$\{\phi_{n}:n \in \omega\}$ is $\Pi^{0}_{2}$-sound and $\Pi^{0}_{1}$-complete - the length of $\phi_{n}$ is bounded above by a polynomial function of $n$ with positive leading coefficient - PRA+$\phi_{n+1}$ always proves 1-consistency of PRA+$\phi_{n}$.

107, TITLE:     Learning Latent Causal Structures with a Redundant Input Neural Network
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13135
AUTHORS:        Jonathan D. Young ; Bryan Andrews ; Gregory F. Cooper ; Xinghua Lu
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we address a problem for which it is known that inputs cause outputs, and these causal relationships are encoded by a causal network among a set of an unknown number of latent variables.

108, TITLE:     Federated Generative Adversarial Learning
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03793
AUTHORS:        Chenyou Fan ; Ping Liu
HIGHLIGHT:      To handle those problems, we propose a novel generative learning scheme utilizing a federated learning framework.

109, TITLE:     The Complexity of Helly-$B_{1}$ EPG Graph Recognition
http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11185
AUTHORS:        Claudson F. Bornstein ; Martin Charles Golumbic ; Tanilson D. Santos ; Uéverton S. Souza ; Jayme L. Szwarcfiter
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we show that given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the problem of determining whether $G$ admits a $B_k$-EPG representation whose edge-intersections of paths satisfy the Helly property, so-called Helly-$B_k$-EPG representation, is in NP, for every $k$ bounded by a polynomial function of $|V(G)|$.

110, TITLE:     Energy-Based Hindsight Experience Prioritization
http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01363
AUTHORS:        Rui Zhao ; Volker Tresp
COMMENTS:       Published in Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2018) as oral presentation (7%), Zurich, Switzerland
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we develop an energy-based framework for prioritizing hindsight experience in robotic manipulation tasks.

111, TITLE:     Efficient Dialog Policy Learning via Positive Memory Retention
http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01371
AUTHORS:        Rui Zhao ; Volker Tresp
COMMENTS:       Published in IEEE Spoken Language Technology (SLT 2018), Athens, Greece
HIGHLIGHT:      To mitigate this problem, we describe an efficient policy gradient method using positive memory retention, which significantly increases the sample-efficiency.
