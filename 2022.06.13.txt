HIGHLIGHT: On the other hand, the best known protocol using incoherent (single-copy) measurements uses $O(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ copies [Kueng-Rauhut-Terstiege '17], and multiple papers have posed it as an open question to understand whether or not this rate is tight. In this work, we fully resolve this question, by showing that any protocol using incoherent measurements, even if they are chosen adaptively, requires $\Omega(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ copies, matching the upper bound of [Kueng-Rauhut-Terstiege '17].

29, TITLE: Self-Supervised Deep Subspace Clustering with Entropy-norm
AUTHORS: Guangyi Zhao ; Simin Kou ; Xuesong Yin
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it suffers from the following three issues in the self-expressive matrix learning process: the first one is less useful information for learning self-expressive weights due to the simple reconstruction loss; the second one is that the construction of the self-expression layer associated with the sample size requires high-computational cost; and the last one is the limited connectivity of the existing regularization terms. In order to address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel model named Self-Supervised deep Subspace Clustering with Entropy-norm (S$^{3}$CE).

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Multi-view Semi-supervised Clustering (DMSC) method, which jointly optimizes three kinds of losses during networks finetuning, including multi-view clustering loss, semi-supervised pairwise constraint loss and multiple autoencoders reconstruction loss.

AUTHORS: Yeachan Kim ; Bonggun Shin
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

87, TITLE: Leveraging Centric Data Federated Learning Using Blockchain For Integrity Assurance
AUTHORS: Riadh Ben Chaabene ; Darine Amayed ; Mohamed Cheriet
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR]
HIGHLIGHT: Problems, however, can arise if there is a lack of quality data for AI-model training, scalability, and maintenance. We propose a data-centric federated learning architecture leveraged by a public blockchain and smart contracts to overcome this significant issue.

88, TITLE: COSTA: Covariance-Preserving Feature Augmentation for Graph Contrastive Learning
AUTHORS: Yifei Zhang ; Hao Zhu ; Zixing Song ; Piotr Koniusz ; Iriwn King
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show that the node embedding obtained via the graph augmentations is highly biased, somewhat limiting contrastive models from learning discriminative features for downstream tasks.Thus, instead of investigating graph augmentation in the input space, we alternatively propose to perform augmentations on the hidden features (feature augmentation).

95, TITLE: AntPivot: Livestream Highlight Detection Via Hierarchical Attention Mechanism
AUTHORS: YANG ZHAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.MM [cs.MM, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although there are lots of approaches proven to be effective in the highlight detection for other modals, the challenges existing in livestream processing, such as the extreme durations, large topic shifts, much irrelevant information and so forth, heavily hamper the adaptation and compatibility of these methods. In this paper, we formulate a new task Livestream Highlight Detection, discuss and analyze the difficulties listed above and propose a novel architecture AntPivot to solve this problem.

96, TITLE: A Bio-inspired Implementation of A Sparse-learning Spike-based Hippocampus Memory Model
AUTHORS: Daniel Casanueva-Morato ; Alvaro Ayuso-Martinez ; Juan P. Dominguez-Morales ; Angel Jimenez-Fernandez ; Gabriel Jimenez-Moreno
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: It is the region of the brain that acts as a short-term memory, allowing the learning and unstructured and rapid storage of information from all the sensory nuclei of the cerebral cortex and its subsequent recall. In this work, we propose a novel bio-inspired memory model based on the hippocampus with the ability to learn memories, recall them from a cue (a part of the memory associated with the rest of the content) and even forget memories when trying to learn others with the same cue.

97, TITLE: Evolutionary Echo State Network: Evolving Reservoirs in The Fourier Space
AUTHORS: Sebastian Basterrech ; Gerardo Rubino
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Since the reservoir is fixed during the training procedure, we may wonder if the computational power of the recurrent structure is fully harnessed. In this article, we propose a new computational model of the ESN type, that represents the reservoir weights in the Fourier space and performs a fine-tuning of these weights applying genetic algorithms in the frequency domain.

104, TITLE: Efficient Per-Shot Convex Hull Prediction By Recurrent Learning
AUTHORS: Somdyuti Paul ; Andrey Norkin ; Alan C. Bovik
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this pre-encoding step is equivalent to an exhaustive search process over the space of possible encoding parameters, which causes significant overhead in terms of both computation and time expenditure. To reduce this overhead, we propose a deep learning based method of content aware convex hull prediction.
