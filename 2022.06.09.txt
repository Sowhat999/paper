AUTHORS: ZICHENG ZHANG et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Nowadays, the mainstream full-reference (FR) metrics are effective to predict the quality of compressed images at coarse-grained levels (the bit rates differences of compressed images are obvious), however, they may perform poorly for fine-grained compressed images whose bit rates differences are quite subtle. Therefore, to better improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) and provide useful guidance for compression algorithms, we propose a full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) method for compressed images of fine-grained levels.

HIGHLIGHT: Towards that goal, we introduce a transformer-based method that uses self-attention to build a rich acoustic context, then predicts RIRs of arbitrary query source-receiver locations through cross-attention.

79, TITLE: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Class Ratio Estimation
AUTHORS: Mingtian Zhang ; Andi Zhang ; Tim Z. Xiao ; Yitong Sun ; Steven McDonagh
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose to unify density ratio based methods under a novel framework that builds energy-based models and employs differing base distributions.

80, TITLE: COVIDx CXR-3: A Large-Scale, Open-Source Benchmark Dataset of Chest X-ray Images for Computer-Aided COVID-19 Diagnostics
AUTHORS: MAYA PAVLOVA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Nevertheless, the accuracy and the generalization capacity of these models are very much dependent on the diversity and the size of the dataset they were trained on. Motivated by this, we introduce COVIDx CXR-3, a large-scale benchmark dataset of CXR images for supporting COVID-19 computer vision research.

81, TITLE: Dual-Distribution Discrepancy for Anomaly Detection in Chest X-Rays
AUTHORS: Yu Cai ; Hao Chen ; Xin Yang ; Yu Zhou ; Kwang-Ting Cheng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.5; J.3]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel strategy, Dual-distribution Discrepancy for Anomaly Detection (DDAD), utilizing both known normal images and unlabeled images.

82, TITLE: Dual Windows Are Significant: Learning from Mediastinal Window and Focusing on Lung Window
AUTHORS: Qiuli Wang ; Xin Tan ; Chen Liu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Window RCNN Network (DWRNet), which mainly learns the distinctive features from the successive mediastinal window.

83, TITLE: Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Absent Correspondences in Pre-operative and Post-Recurrence Brain Tumor MRI Scans
AUTHORS: Tony C. W. Mok ; Albert C. S. Chung
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based deformable registration method that jointly estimates regions with absent correspondence and bidirectional deformation fields.

84, TITLE: A New Method Incorporating Deep Learning with Shape Priors for Left Ventricular Segmentation in Myocardial Perfusion SPECT Images
AUTHORS: FUBAO ZHU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The purpose of this paper is to develop and validate a new method incorporating deep learning with shape priors to accurately extract the LV myocardium for automatic measurement of LV functional parameters.

85, TITLE: Generative Myocardial Motion Tracking Via Latent Space Exploration with Biomechanics-informed Prior
AUTHORS: Chen Qin ; Shuo Wang ; Chen Chen ; Wenjia Bai ; Daniel Rueckert
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In contrast to most existing approaches which impose explicit generic regularization such as smoothness, in this work we propose a novel method that can implicitly learn an application-specific biomechanics-informed prior and embed it into a neural network-parameterized transformation model.

86, TITLE: Hypernetwork-based Personalized Federated Learning for Multi-Institutional CT Imaging
AUTHORS: ZIYUAN YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Deep learning-based methods are considered promising in CT reconstruction, but these network models are usually trained with the measured data obtained from specific scanning protocol and need to centralizedly collect large amounts of data, which will lead to serious data domain shift, and privacy concerns. To relieve these problems, in this paper, we propose a hypernetwork-based federated learning method for personalized CT imaging, dubbed as HyperFed.
