91, TITLE: Semantics-guided Transformer-based Sensor Fusion for Improved Waypoint Prediction
AUTHORS: Hwan-Soo Choi ; Jongoh Jeong ; Young Hoo Cho ; Kuk-Jin Yoon ; Jong-Hwan Kim
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While it is well known that multiple data modalities promote mutual contextual exchange, deployment to practical driving scenarios requires global 3D scene understanding in real-time with minimal computations, thus placing greater significance on training strategies given a limited number of practically usable sensors. In this light, we exploit carefully selected auxiliary tasks that are highly correlated with the target task of interest (e.g., traffic light recognition and semantic segmentation) by fusing auxiliary task features and also using auxiliary heads for waypoint prediction based on imitation learning.

93, TITLE: Emo-DNA: Emotion Decoupling and Alignment Learning for Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition
AUTHORS: JIAXIN YE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing methods, typically based on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), struggle to learn corpus-invariant features by global distribution alignment, but unfortunately, the resulting features are mixed with corpus-specific features or not class-discriminative. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Emotion Decoupling aNd Alignment learning framework (EMO-DNA) for cross-corpus SER, a novel UDA method to learn emotion-relevant corpus-invariant features.

96, TITLE: A Stochastic Optimization Approach to Train Non-linear Neural Networks with Regularization of Higher-order Total Variation
AUTHORS: Akifumi Okuno
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.CO, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: While highly expressive parametric models including deep neural networks have an advantage to model complicated concepts, training such highly non-linear models is known to yield a high risk of notorious overfitting. To address this issue, this study considers a $k$th order total variation ($k$-TV) regularization, which is defined as the squared integral of the $k$th order derivative of the parametric models to be trained; penalizing the $k$-TV is expected to yield a smoother function, which is expected to avoid overfitting.
