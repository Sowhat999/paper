AUTHORS:        Amir Bar ; Roei Herzig ; Xiaolong Wang ; Gal Chechik ; Trevor Darrell ; Amir Globerson
HIGHLIGHT:      Towards this end, we introduce a generative model (AG2Vid) based on Action Graphs, a natural and convenient structure that represents the dynamics of actions between objects over time.
