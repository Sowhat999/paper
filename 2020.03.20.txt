AUTHORS:        Ren Yang ; Fabian Mentzer ; Luc Van Gool ; Radu Timofte
COMMENTS:       CVPR 2020 Camera-Ready
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Learned Video Compression (HLVC) method with three hierarchical quality layers and a recurrent enhancement network.

51, TITLE:      Fully Unsupervised Probabilistic Noise2Void
http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12291
AUTHORS:        Mangal Prakash ; Manan Lalit ; Pavel Tomancak ; Alexander Krull ; Florian Jug
COMMENTS:       Accepted at ISBI 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      Here, we present improvements to PN2V that (i) replace histogram based noise models by parametric noise models, and (ii) show how suitable noise models can be created even in the absence of calibration data.

52, TITLE:      Leveraging Self-supervised Denoising for Image Segmentation
http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12239
AUTHORS:        Mangal Prakash ; Tim-Oliver Buchholz ; Manan Lalit ; Pavel Tomancak ; Florian Jug ; Alexander Krull
COMMENTS:       accepted at ISBI 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      Hence, we propose to use denoising networks to improve the performance of other DL-based image segmentation methods.

53, TITLE:      Conditional Convolutions for Instance Segmentation
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05664
AUTHORS:        Zhi Tian ; Chunhua Shen ; Hao Chen
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a simple yet effective instance segmentation framework, termed CondInst (conditional convolutions for instance segmentation).

54, TITLE:      Dual-attention Guided Dropblock Module for Weakly Supervised Object Localization
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04719
AUTHORS:        Junhui Yin ; Siqing Zhang ; Dongliang Chang ; Zhanyu Ma ; Jun Guo
COMMENTS:       Technical Reports
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we present a dual-attention guided dropblock module, and aim at learning the informative and complementary visual features for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL).
