AUTHORS: Luuk van den Bent ; Tom�s Coleman ; Robert Babuska
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The main obstacle to automation lies in the difficulty of developing a reliable robotic grasping system for already harvested trusses. We propose a method to grasp trusses that are stacked in a crate with considerable clutter, which is how they are commonly stored and transported after harvest.

174, TITLE: Assessing Look-Ahead Bias in Stock Return Predictions Generated By GPT Sentiment Analysis
AUTHORS: Paul Glasserman ; Caden Lin
CATEGORY: q-fin.GN [q-fin.GN, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This bias can take two forms: a look-ahead bias, in which the LLM may have specific knowledge of the stock returns that followed a news article, and a distraction effect, in which general knowledge of the companies named interferes with the measurement of a text's sentiment. We investigate these sources of bias through trading strategies driven by the sentiment of financial news headlines.

175, TITLE: Wiki-En-ASR-Adapt: Large-scale Synthetic Dataset for English ASR Customization
AUTHORS: Alexandra Antonova
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]

176, TITLE: Unpaired Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Image Super-Resolution Via Frequency-Aware Inverse-Consistency GAN
AUTHORS: WEIWEN ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been commonly used in the unpaired setting, but it may struggle to accurately preserve fine-grained capillary details, which are critical biomarkers for OCTA. In this paper, our approach aspires to preserve these details by leveraging the frequency information, which represents details as high-frequencies ($\textbf{hf}$) and coarse-grained backgrounds as low-frequencies ($\textbf{lf}$).
