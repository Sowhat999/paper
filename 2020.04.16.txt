HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we find that the current trend in the 
field to use very large models is detrimental for low-resource 
languages, since it makes training more difficult and hurts overall 
performance, confirming previous observations.



54, TITLE:      Constrained Deep Networks: Lagrangian Optimization via Log-Barrier Extensions

http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04205

AUTHORS:        Hoel Kervadec ; Jose Dolz ; Jing Yuan ; Christian Desrosiers ; Eric Granger ; Ismail Ben Ayed

HIGHLIGHT:      We propose log-barrier extensions, which approximate 
Lagrangian optimization of constrained-CNN problems with a sequence of 
unconstrained losses.
