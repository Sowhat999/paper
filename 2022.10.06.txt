AUTHORS: Yu Quan ; Dong Zhang ; Liyan Zhang ; Jinhui Tang

AUTHORS: Yijun Dong ; Yuege Xie ; Rachel Ward
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing reweighting algorithms have focused on hard- and soft- thresholding of the label-sparse data, which results in loss of information and reduced sample efficiency by discarding valuable data input. For this setting, we propose AdaWAC as an adaptive weighting algorithm that introduces a set of trainable weights which, at the saddle point of the underlying objective, assigns label-dense samples to supervised cross-entropy loss and label-sparse samples to unsupervised consistency regularization.

AUTHORS: Shengjie Liu ; Chuang Zhu ; Wenqi Tang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For scenarios where weak supervision and cross-domain problems coexist, this paper defines a new task: unsupervised domain adaptation based on weak source domain labels (WUDA). To explore solutions for this task, this paper proposes two intuitive frameworks: 1) Perform weakly supervised semantic segmentation in the source domain, and then implement unsupervised domain adaptation; 2) Train an object detection model using source domain data, then detect objects in the target domain and implement weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

60, TITLE: InterFace:Adjustable Angular Margin Inter-class Loss for Deep Face Recognition
AUTHORS: MENG SANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although a great deal of previous work has been done to optimize the boundary penalty to improve the discriminative power of the model, adding a fixed margin penalty to the depth feature and the corresponding weight is not consistent with the pattern of data in the real scenario. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel loss function, InterFace, releasing the constraint of adding a margin penalty only between the depth feature and the corresponding weight to push the separability of classes by adding corresponding margin penalties between the depth features and all weights.

In this paper, we try to address this issue by designing an edge feature scheme and an add-on layer between every two stacked graph convolution layers in GCNN.

64, TITLE: Variational Prompt Tuning Improves Generalization of Vision-language Models
AUTHORS: MOHAMMAD MAHDI DERAKHSHANI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing works for prompt tuning are however prone to damaging the generalization capabilities of the foundation models, because the learned prompts lack the capacity of covering certain concepts within the language model. To avoid such limitation, we propose a probabilistic modeling of the underlying distribution of prompts, allowing prompts within the support of an associated concept to be derived through stochastic sampling.

AUTHORS: Abhra Chaudhuri ; Massimiliano Mancini ; Zeynep Akata ; Anjan Dutta
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Fine-grained categories that largely share the same set of parts cannot be discriminated based on part information alone, as they mostly differ in the way the local parts relate to the overall global structure of the object.

AUTHORS: Cheng-Wei Lin ; Tung-I Chen ; Hsin-Ying Lee ; Wen-Chin Chen ; Winston H. Hsu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: We first reduce the pose differences between input point clouds by aligning global features; then we match the local features to further refine the inaccurate alignments resulting from distribution variances. As global feature alignment requires the features to preserve the poses of input point clouds and local feature matching expects the features to be invariant to these poses, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant feature extractor to simultaneously generate two types of features.

AUTHORS: Shiqian Li ; Kewen Wu ; Chi Zhang ; Yixin Zhu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]

In this work, we take a closer look at this assumption, exploring this fundamental hypothesis by comparing two learning mechanisms: Learning from Dynamics (LfD) and Learning from Intuition (LfI).
