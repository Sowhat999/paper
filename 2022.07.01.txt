86, TITLE: Consensus Function from An $L_p^q-$norm Regularization Term for Its Use As Adaptive Activation Functions in Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Juan Heredia-Juesas ; José Á. Martínez-Lorenzo

In this paper we propose the definition and utilization of an implicit, parametric, non-linear activation function that adapts its shape during the training process.

We approach this problem by combining a recurrent attractor network with a feedforward network that learns distributed representations using an unsupervised Hebbian-Bayesian learning rule.

105, TITLE: A Medical Image Fusion Method Based on MDLatLRRv2
AUTHORS: Xu Song ; Xiao-Jun Wu ; Hui Li
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Since MDLatLRR only considers detailed parts (salient features) of input images extracted by latent low-rank representation (LatLRR), it doesn't use base parts (principal features) extracted by LatLRR effectively. Therefore, we proposed an improved multi-level decomposition method called MDLatLRRv2 which effectively analyzes and utilizes all the image features obtained by LatLRR.
