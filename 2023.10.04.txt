HIGHLIGHT: As the difficulty of collecting ground truth optical flow in real-world scenarios, most of the existing methods of learning optical flow still adopt synthetic dataset for supervised training or utilize photometric consistency across temporally adjacent video frames to drive the unsupervised learning, where the former typically has issues of generalizability while the latter usually performs worse than the supervised ones. To tackle such challenges, we propose to leverage the geometric connection between optical flow estimation and stereo matching (based on the similarity upon finding pixel correspondences across images) to unify various real-world depth estimation datasets for generating supervised training data upon optical flow.

To improve robustness, we propose a deformable registration method using pairs of cycle-consistent Implicit Neural Representations: each implicit representation is linked to a second implicit representation that estimates the opposite transformation, causing each network to act as a regularizer for its paired opposite.
