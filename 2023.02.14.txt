AUTHORS: JIAMING SHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IR]
HIGHLIGHT: With the growing need for news headline generation, we argue that the hallucination issue, namely the generated headlines being not supported by the original news stories, is a critical challenge for the deployment of this feature in web-scale systems Meanwhile, due to the infrequency of hallucination cases and the requirement of careful reading for raters to reach the correct consensus, it is difficult to acquire a large dataset for training a model to detect such hallucinations through human curation. In this work, we present a new framework named ExHalder to address this challenge for headline hallucination detection.

We identify within the nature of this entanglement a mechanism of contextual updating and illustrate the mechanism in the example we analyze.
