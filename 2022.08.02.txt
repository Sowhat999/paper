AUTHORS: Xiaoyuan Guo ; Jiali Duan ; C. -C. Jay Kuo ; Judy Wawira Gichoya ; Imon Banerjee

In this work we solve these issues by introducing a volume deformation method which is real-time, easy to edit with off-the-shelf software and can extrapolate convincingly.

We resolve this discrepancy by formulating the multi-objective NAS problem as a quality diversity optimization (QDO) problem and introduce three quality diversity NAS optimizers (two of them belonging to the group of multifidelity optimizers), which search for high-performing yet diverse architectures that are optimal for application-specific niches, e.g., hardware constraints.

HIGHLIGHT: Static analysis is a mature field with applications to bug detection, security analysis, and code optimization, etc. To facilitate these applications, static analysis frameworks play an essential role by providing a series of fundamental services such as program abstraction, control flow graph construction, and points-to/alias information computation, etc.

164, TITLE: Implementing and Verifying Release-Acquire Transactional Memory (Extended Version)
AUTHORS: Sadegh Dalvandi ; Brijesh Dongol
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, TM under relaxed memory, e.g., C11 (the 2011 C/C++ standard) is still poorly understood, lacking rigorous foundations that support verifiable implementations. This paper addresses this gap by developing TMS2-RA, a relaxed operational TM specification.

165, TITLE: Typed SLD-Resolution: Dynamic Typing for Logic Programming
AUTHORS: João Barbosa ; Mário Florido ; Vítor Santos Costa
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we define a new operational semantics called TSLD-resolution, which stands for Typed SLD-resolution, where we include a value "wrong", that corresponds to the detection of a type error at run-time. For this we define a new typed unification algorithm.

173, TITLE: Speckle2Speckle: Unsupervised Learning of Ultrasound Speckle Filtering Without Clean Data
AUTHORS: Rüdiger Göbl ; Christoph Hennersperger ; Nassir Navab
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Learning based techniques on the other hand suffer from the need for a target image for training (in case of fully supervised techniques) or require narrow, complex physics-based models of the speckle appearance that might not apply in all cases. With this work we propose a deep-learning based method for speckle removal without these limitations.
