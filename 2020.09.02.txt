COMMENTS:       12 pages, 1 table
CATEGORY:       cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, math.DS]

COMMENTS:       12 pages, 1 figure
CATEGORY:       cs.OH [cs.OH, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we emphasise this allagmatic theory by showing how Simondon's philosophical concepts can be used to formulate a generic computer model or metamodel for complex systems modelling and its implementation in program code, according to generic programming.

CATEGORY:       cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.LO, cs.SE, D.2; D.3]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose LLOV, a fast, lightweight, language agnostic, and static data race checker for OpenMP programs based on the LLVM compiler framework.

COMMENTS:       Accepted in ACM TACO
CATEGORY:       cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.LG, cs.NE, cs.SE]

40, TITLE:      On Termination of Polynomial Programs with Equality Conditions
http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05201
AUTHORS:        Yangjia Li ; Naijun Zhan ; Mingshuai Chen ; Hui Lu ; Guohua Wu ; Joost-Pieter Katoen
CATEGORY:       cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.SC, 68Q60 (Primary) 68W30, 68Q17 (Secondary)]
HIGHLIGHT:      We present an explicit recursive function which is essentially Ackermannian, to compute the maximal length of ascending chains of polynomial ideals under a control function, and thereby obtain a complete answer to the questions raised by Seidenberg.

41, TITLE:      Type-driven Neural Programming by Example
http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12613
AUTHORS:        Kiara Grouwstra
CATEGORY:       cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.PL, I.2.2]
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a way to incorporate programming types into a neural program synthesis approach for programming by example.

42, TITLE:      Patching as Translation: the Data and the Metaphor
http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10707
AUTHORS:        Yangruibo Ding ; Baishakhi Ray ; Premkumar Devanbu ; Vincent J. Hellendoorn
CATEGORY:       cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.LG, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we examine a common example of this phenomenon: the conceit that "software patching is like language translation". We will publicly release our replication data and materials at https://github.com/ARiSE-Lab/Patch-as-translation.

43, TITLE:      Parallel Rescoring with Transformer for Streaming On-Device Speech Recognition
http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13093
AUTHORS:        Wei Li ; James Qin ; Chung-Cheng Chiu ; Ruoming Pang ; Yanzhang He
COMMENTS:       Proceedings of Interspeech, 2020
CATEGORY:       eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work we explore replacing the LSTM layers in the 2nd-pass rescorer with Transformer layers, which can process the entire hypothesis sequences in parallel and can therefore utilize the on-device computation resources more efficiently.

44, TITLE:      Thick Cloud Removal of Remote Sensing Images Using Temporal Smoothness and Sparsity-Regularized Tensor Optimization
