COMMENTS:       This is a redundant version of 1910.04966
HIGHLIGHT:      Recently, more and more works have proposed to drive evolutionary algorithms using machine learning models.Usually, the performance of such model based evolutionary algorithms is highly dependent on the training qualities of the adopted models.Since it usually requires a certain amount of data (i.e. the candidate solutions generated by the algorithms) for model training, the performance deteriorates rapidly with the increase of the problem scales, due to the curse of dimensionality.To address this issue, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm driven by the generative adversarial networks (GANs).

AUTHORS:        Lukas Liebel ; Ksenia Bittner ; Marco Körner
COMMENTS:       This paper was accepted for publication in the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a modular multi-task learning concept that consolidates existing approaches into a generalized framework.

63, TITLE:      Learning to Deceive with Attention-Based Explanations
http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07913
AUTHORS:        Danish Pruthi ; Mansi Gupta ; Bhuwan Dhingra ; Graham Neubig ; Zachary C. Lipton
COMMENTS:       Accepted to ACL 2020 as a long paper. Updated version
HIGHLIGHT:      We call the latter use of attention mechanisms into question by demonstrating a simple method for training models to produce deceptive attention masks.

COMMENTS:       To appear in CVPR 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose DOPS, a fast single-stage 3D object detection method for LIDAR data.

65, TITLE:      CoPhy: Counterfactual Learning of Physical Dynamics
http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12000
AUTHORS:        Fabien Baradel ; Natalia Neverova ; Julien Mille ; Greg Mori ; Christian Wolf
COMMENTS:       ICLR 2020 -Spotlight presentation
HIGHLIGHT:      We develop the CoPhy benchmark to assess the capacity of the state-of-the-art models for causal physical reasoning in a synthetic 3D environment and propose a model for learning the physical dynamics in a counterfactual setting. This work poses a new problem of counterfactual learning of object mechanics from visual input.

COMMENTS:       9 pages, 4 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a physics-informed machine learning method to predict the time average of a chaotic attractor.
