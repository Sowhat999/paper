HIGHLIGHT: Because most students are unfamiliar with the language and code editors and IDEs often lack the support for COOL, writing code and test programs in COOL are a burden to students, causing them to not fully understand many important and advanced features of the language and compiler. In this tool paper, we describe COOLIO,an extension to support COOL in the popular VSCode IDE.

81, TITLE: C-rusted: The Advantages of Rust, in C, Without The Disadvantages
AUTHORS: Roberto Bagnara ; Abramo Bagnara ; Federico Serafini
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.CR, cs.SE, 68N15, F.3.1; D.3.0]
HIGHLIGHT: C-rusted: The Advantages of Rust, in C, Without The Disadvantages

82, TITLE: Towards Text-based Human Search and Approach with An Intelligent Robot Dog
AUTHORS: Jeongeun Park ; Jefferson Silveria ; Matthew Pan ; Sungjoon Choi
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a SOCratic model for Robots Approaching humans based on TExt System (SOCRATES) focusing on the human search and approach based on free-form textual description; the robot first searches for the target user, then the robot proceeds to approach in a human-friendly manner.

83, TITLE: Controllability-Aware Unsupervised Skill Discovery
AUTHORS: Seohong Park ; Kimin Lee ; Youngwoon Lee ; Pieter Abbeel
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce a novel unsupervised skill discovery method, Controllability-aware Skill Discovery (CSD), which actively seeks complex, hard-to-control skills without supervision.

84, TITLE: GTR-CTRL: Instrument and Genre Conditioning for Guitar-Focused Music Generation with Transformers
AUTHORS: PEDRO SARMENTO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.MM, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we use the DadaGP dataset for guitar tab music generation, a corpus of over 26k songs in GuitarPro and token formats.

85, TITLE: Refined $F_5$ Algorithms for Ideals of Minors of Square Matrices
AUTHORS: Sriram Gopalakrishnan ; Vincent Neiger ; Mohab Safey El Din
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, math.AC]
HIGHLIGHT: We consider the problem of computing a grevlex Gr\"obner basis for the set $F_r(M)$ of minors of size $r$ of an $n\times n$ matrix $M$ of generic linear forms over a field of characteristic zero or large enough.

86, TITLE: Cross-Corpora Spoken Language Identification with Domain Diversification and Generalization
AUTHORS: Spandan Dey ; Md Sahidullah ; Goutam Saha
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Second, we introduce the idea of domain generalization considering the augmentation methods as pseudo-domains. Towards this, we investigate both domain-invariant and domain-aware approaches.

87, TITLE: EVC: Towards Real-Time Neural Image Compression with Mask Decay
AUTHORS: Guo-Hua Wang ; Jiahao Li ; Bin Li ; Yan Lu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an Efficient single-model Variable-bit-rate Codec (EVC), which is able to run at 30 FPS with 768x512 input images and still outperforms VVC for the RD performance.

88, TITLE: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Cervical Cytology Diagnostics in Low-Data Regime and Low-Resource Setting
AUTHORS: THOMAS STEGMÜLLER et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Developing AI algorithms, e.g., deep learning to analyze the digitized cytology images suited to resource-constrained countries is appealing.

89, TITLE: Tackling Bias in The Dice Similarity Coefficient: Introducing NDSC for White Matter Lesion Segmentation
AUTHORS: VATSAL RAINA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the DSC metric has been shown to be biased to the occurrence rate of the positive class in the ground-truth, and hence should be considered in combination with other metrics. This work describes a detailed analysis of the recently proposed normalised Dice Similarity Coefficient (nDSC) for binary segmentation tasks as an adaptation of DSC which scales the precision at a fixed recall rate to tackle this bias.

90, TITLE: Digital Twin-Aided Learning for Managing Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted, Uplink, User-Centric Cell-Free Systems
AUTHORS: Yingping Cui ; Tiejun Lv ; Wei Ni ; Abbas Jamalipour
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, we propose a novel learning framework that maximizes the sum-rate by jointly optimizing the access point and user association (AUA), power control, and RIS beamforming.

91, TITLE: The LuViRA Dataset: Measurement Description
AUTHORS: ILAYDA YAMAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.CV, cs.SD, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a dataset to evaluate localization algorithms, which utilizes vision, audio, and radio sensors: the Lund University Vision, Radio, and Audio (LuViRA) Dataset.
