175, TITLE: T-AutoML: Automated Machine Learning for Lesion Segmentation Using Transformers in 3D Medical Imaging
AUTHORS: DONG YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Researchers have proposed various detection and segmentation algorithms to address this task.

176, TITLE: Improving The Otsu Thresholding Method of Global Binarization Using Ring Theory for Ultrasonographies of Congestive Heart Failure
AUTHORS: Alisa Rahim ; Esley Torres
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, math.RA, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper examines the Otsu thresholding method and incorporates new elements to account for different image features meant to better isolate congestive heart failure indicators in ultrasound images.

177, TITLE: Fracture Detection in Wrist X-ray Images Using Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Models
AUTHORS: FIRAT HARDALAÇ et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: To further improve detection procedures in the study, 5 different ensemble models were developed, which were later used to reform an ensemble model to develop a detection model unique to our study, titled wrist fracture detection combo (WFD_C).

178, TITLE: Estimation of Acetabular Version from Anteroposterior Pelvic Radiograph Employing Deep Learning
AUTHORS: Ata Jodeiri ; Hadi Seyedarabi ; Fatemeh Shahbazi ; Seyed Mohammad Mahdi Hashemi ; Seyyedhossein Shafiei
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we applied a deep learning approach on anteroposterior pelvic X-rays to measure anatomical version, eliminating the necessity of using Computed tomography scan.

179, TITLE: Deep Joint Demosaicing and High Dynamic Range Imaging Within A Single Shot
AUTHORS: YILUN XU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For the latter one, an exposure-guidance method is proposed against the interference from over- and under-exposed pixels.

180, TITLE: Pseudo-domains in Imaging Data Improve Prediction of Future Disease Status in Multi-center Studies
AUTHORS: MATTHIAS PERKONIGG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose a prediction method that can cope with a high number of different scanning sites and a low number of samples per site.

181, TITLE: Moment Transform-Based Compressive Sensing in Image Processing
AUTHORS: T. Kalampokas ; G. A. Papakostas
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and moment transform (Tchebichef, Krawtchouk) are compared in order to achieve image denoising of Gaussian additive white noise based on compressive sensing and sparse approximation theory.
