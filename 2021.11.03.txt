CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To amalgamate these methods and thereby maximize their distinct strengths, here we show that the Vision Transformer, a recently developed deep learning architecture with straightforward decomposable configuration, is ideally suitable for split learning without sacrificing performance.

87, TITLE: ISP-Agnostic Image Reconstruction for Under-Display Cameras
AUTHORS: Miao Qi ; Yuqi Li ; Wolfgang Heidrich
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an image-restoration pipeline that is ISP-agnostic, i.e. it can be combined with any legacy ISP to produce a final image that matches the appearance of regular cameras using the same ISP.

88, TITLE: Constructing High-Order Signed Distance Maps from Computed Tomography Data with Application to Bone Morphometry
AUTHORS: Bryce A. Besler ; Tannis D. Kemp ; Nils D. Forkert ; Steven K. Boyd
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: An algorithm is presented for constructing high-order signed distance fields for two phase materials imaged with computed tomography.

89, TITLE: Out of Distribution Detection for Skin and Malaria Images
AUTHORS: MUHAMMAD ZAIDA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose an approach to robustly classify OoD samples in skin and malaria images without the need to access labeled OoD samples during training.
