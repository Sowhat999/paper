COMMENTS:       CVPR2020: Revisiting Knowledge Distillation via Label Smoothing Regularization
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we challenge this common belief by following experimental observations: 1) beyond the acknowledgment that the teacher can improve the student, the student can also enhance the teacher significantly by reversing the KD procedure; 2) a poorly-trained teacher with much lower accuracy than the student can still improve the latter significantly.
