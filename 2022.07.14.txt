2, TITLE: Reinforcement Learning Assisted Recursive QAOA
AUTHORS: Yash J. Patel ; Sofiene Jerbi ; Thomas Bäck ; Vedran Dunjko
CATEGORY: quant-ph [quant-ph, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, as we are tackling $\mathsf{NP}$-hard problems (specifically, the Ising spin model), it is expected that RQAOA does fail, raising the question of designing even better quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization. In this spirit, we identify and analyze cases where RQAOA fails and, based on this, propose a reinforcement learning enhanced RQAOA variant (RL-RQAOA) that improves upon RQAOA.

AUTHORS: Mattia Fumagalli ; Marco Boffo ; Daqian Shi ; Mayukh Bagchi ; Fausto Giunchiglia
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.DB]
HIGHLIGHT: In addition to this, a key challenge is to determine how to manipulate (and embed) these data, which are often in the form of particular triples (i.e., subject, predicate, object), to enable the learning process. In this paper, we describe the LiveSchema initiative, namely a gateway that offers a family of services to easily access, analyze, transform and exploit knowledge graph schemas, with the main goal of facilitating the reuse of these resources in machine learning use cases.

AUTHORS: Jinyi Hu ; Xiaoyuan Yi ; Wenhao Li ; Maosong Sun ; Xing Xie
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, due to the sequential nature of the text, auto-regressive decoders tend to ignore latent variables and then reduce to simple language models, known as the KL vanishing problem, which would further deteriorate when VAE is combined with Transformer-based structures. To ameliorate this problem, we propose DELLA, a novel variational Transformer framework.

HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose Discriminative-SSL-based Slimmable Pretrained Networks (DSPNet), which can be trained at once and then slimmed to multiple sub-networks of various sizes, each of which faithfully learns good representation and can serve as good initialization for downstream tasks with various resource budgets.

26, TITLE: Context-Consistent Semantic Image Editing with Style-Preserved Modulation
AUTHORS: Wuyang Luo ; Su Yang ; Hong Wang ; Bo Long ; Weishan Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We attribute this to the fact that SPADE only uses an image-independent local semantic layout but ignores the image-specific styles included in the known pixels. To address this issue, we propose a style-preserved modulation (SPM) comprising two modulations processes: The first modulation incorporates the contextual style and semantic layout, and then generates two fused modulation parameters.

27, TITLE: Entry-Flipped Transformer for Inference and Prediction of Participant Behavior

To address this issue, we propose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop in our regression network for well-aligned human mesh recovery and extend it to PyMAF-X for the recovery of expressive full-body models.

32, TITLE: Beyond Hard Labels: Investigating Data Label Distributions
AUTHORS: Vasco Grossmann ; Lars Schmarje ; Reinhard Koch
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]

Therefore, we compare the disparity of learning with hard and soft labels quantitatively and qualitatively for a synthetic and a real-world dataset.

33, TITLE: Is One Annotation Enough? A Data-centric Image Classification Benchmark for Noisy and Ambiguous Label Estimation
AUTHORS: LARS SCHMARJE et. al.

37, TITLE: Trans4Map: Revisiting Holistic Top-down Mapping from Egocentric Images to Allocentric Semantics with Vision Transformers
AUTHORS: Chang Chen ; Jiaming Zhang ; Kailun Yang ; Kunyu Peng ; Rainer Stiefelhagen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: However, endowing mobile agents with such a spatial sensing ability is still a challenge, due to two difficulties: (1) the previous convolutional models are limited by the local receptive field, thus, struggling to capture holistic long-range dependencies during observation; (2) the excessive computational budgets required for success, often lead to a separation of the mapping pipeline into stages, resulting the entire mapping process inefficient. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based framework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map.

38, TITLE: Sample-dependent Adaptive Temperature Scaling for Improved Calibration
AUTHORS: Tom Joy ; Francesco Pinto ; Ser-Nam Lim ; Philip H. S. Torr ; Puneet K. Dokania
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: With this insight, we base our method on the observation that different samples contribute to the calibration error by varying amounts, with some needing to increase their confidence and others needing to decrease it. Therefore, for each input, we propose to predict a different temperature value, allowing us to adjust the mismatch between confidence and accuracy at a finer granularity.

AUTHORS: Jiayin Sun ; Qiulei Dong
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Most of the existing OSR methods are inductive methods, which generally suffer from the domain shift problem that the learned model from the known-class domain might be unsuitable for the unknown-class domain. Addressing this problem, inspired by the success of transductive learning for alleviating the domain shift problem in many other visual tasks, we propose an Iterative Transductive OSR framework, called IT-OSR, which implements three explored modules iteratively, including a reliability sampling module, a feature generation module, and a baseline update module.

AUTHORS: TIANYU HUANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing works mainly focus on integrating the semantic features and structural features to mine the similarity and discontinuity between mirror and non-mirror regions, or introducing depth information to help analyze the existence of mirrors. In this work, we observe that a real object typically forms a loose symmetry relationship with its corresponding reflection in the mirror, which is beneficial in distinguishing mirrors from real objects.

AUTHORS: Nathan Louis ; Tylan N. Templin ; Travis D. Eliason ; Daniel P. Nicolella ; Jason J. Corso
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Analyzing sports performance or preventing injuries requires capturing ground reaction forces (GRFs) exerted by the human body during certain movements. Standard practice uses physical markers paired with force plates in a controlled environment, but this is marred by high costs, lengthy implementation time, and variance in repeat experiments; hence, we propose GRF inference from video.

69, TITLE: Semi-supervised Ranking for Object Image Blur Assessment
AUTHORS: QIANG LI et. al.

To address these limitations, we propose Task Agnostic Representation Consolidation (TARC), a two-stage training paradigm for CL that intertwines task-agnostic and task-specific learning whereby self-supervised training is followed by supervised learning for each task.

90, TITLE: DeepTIMe: Deep Time-Index Meta-Learning for Non-Stationary Time-Series Forecasting
AUTHORS: Gerald Woo ; Chenghao Liu ; Doyen Sahoo ; Akshat Kumar ; Steven Hoi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Indeed, while naive deep time-index based models are far more expressive than the manually predefined function representations of classical time-index based models, they are inadequate for forecasting due to the lack of inductive biases, and the non-stationarity of time-series. In this paper, we propose DeepTIMe, a deep time-index based model trained via a meta-learning formulation which overcomes these limitations, yielding an efficient and accurate forecasting model.

We address these problems by introducing RcTorch, a PyTorch based RC neural network package with automated HP tuning.

Based on this observation, we propose a hierarchical quantization method, discretizing the learned feature vectors using a jointly-trained dictionary with a constrained size, in order to improve the generalisation of the registration networks.
