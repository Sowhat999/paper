HIGHLIGHT: We show that under standard computational complexity assumptions, neither of the problems NS-TEXP nor $k$-arb NS-TEXP allow for polynomial kernels in the standard parameters: number of vertices $n$, lifetime $L$, number of vertices to visit $k$, and maximal number of connected components per time step $\gamma$; as well as in the combined parameters $L+k$, $L + \gamma$, and $k+\gamma$. On the way to establishing these lower bounds, we answer a couple of questions left open by Erlebach and Spooner.

CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we present the first novel collaborative self-supervised learning method to solve the challenge of insufficient labeled radiomic data, whose characteristics are different from text and image data.

243, TITLE: Simple U-net Based Synthetic Polyp Image Generation: Polyp to Negative and Negative to Polyp
AUTHORS: Hemin Ali Qadir ; Ilangko Balasingham ; Younghak Shin
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose a deep learning-based polyp image generation framework that generates synthetic polyp images that are similar to real ones.

244, TITLE: Mimicking A Pathologist: Dual Attention Model for Scoring of Gigapixel Histology Images
AUTHORS: Manahil Raza ; Ruqayya Awan ; Raja Muhammad Saad Bashir ; Talha Qaiser ; Nasir M. Rajpoot
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel dual attention approach, consisting of two main components, to mimic visual examination by a pathologist.

245, TITLE: Brainomaly: Unsupervised Neurologic Disease Detection Utilizing Unannotated T1-weighted Brain MR Images
AUTHORS: MD MAHFUZUR RAHMAN SIDDIQUEE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: A major issue remains unaddressed in these studies, which is selecting the best model for inference from a set of trained models without annotated samples. To address this issue, we propose Brainomaly, a GAN-based image-to-image translation method for neurologic disease detection using unannotated T1-weighted brain MRIs of individuals with neurologic diseases and healthy subjects.

246, TITLE: An Efficient and Robust Method for Chest X-Ray Rib Suppression That Improves Pulmonary Abnormality Diagnosis
AUTHORS: Di Xu ; Qifan Xu ; Kevin Nhieu ; Dan Ruan ; Ke Sheng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We hereby propose a generalizable yet efficient workflow of two stages: (1) training pairs generation with GT bone shadows eliminated in by a physical model in spatially transformed gradient fields.

247, TITLE: Domain Agnostic Pipeline for Retina Vessel Segmentation
AUTHORS: Benjamin Hou
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we show that it is possible to achieve near state-of-the-art performance, by crafting a careful thought pre-processing pipeline, without having to resort to complex networks and/or training routines.

248, TITLE: Dual-Domain Self-Supervised Learning for Accelerated Non-Cartesian MRI Reconstruction
AUTHORS: BO ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we present a fully self-supervised approach for accelerated non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction which leverages self-supervision in both k-space and image domains.

249, TITLE: Towards Simultaneous Segmentation of Liver Tumors and Intrahepatic Vessels Via Cross-attention Mechanism
AUTHORS: Haopeng Kuang ; Dingkang Yang ; Shunli Wang ; Xiaoying Wang ; Lihua Zhang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we collect the first liver tumor, and vessel segmentation benchmark datasets containing 52 portal vein phase computed tomography images with liver, liver tumor, and vessel annotations. In this case, we propose a 3D U-shaped Cross-Attention Network (UCA-Net) that utilizes a tailored cross-attention mechanism instead of the traditional skip connection to effectively model the encoder and decoder feature.
