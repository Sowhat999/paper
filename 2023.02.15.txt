80, TITLE: The Meta-Evaluation Problem in Explainable AI: Identifying Reliable Estimators with MetaQuantus
AUTHORS: ANNA HEDSTRÖM et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: One of the unsolved challenges in XAI is estimating the performance of these explanation methods for neural networks, which has resulted in numerous competing metrics with little to no indication of which one is to be preferred. In this paper, to identify the most reliable evaluation method in a given explainability context, we propose MetaQuantus -- a simple yet powerful framework that meta-evaluates two complementary performance characteristics of an evaluation method: its resilience to noise and reactivity to randomness.

To overcome this limitation of existing approaches, we propose Masked Multi-Step Multivariate Probabilistic Forecasting (MMMPF), a novel and general framework to train any neural network model capable of generating a sequence of outputs, that combines both the temporal information from the past and the known information about the future to make probabilistic predictions.

87, TITLE: SimpleKT: A Simple But Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Knowledge Tracing
AUTHORS: Zitao Liu ; Qiongqiong Liu ; Jiahao Chen ; Shuyan Huang ; Weiqi Luo
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocol \citep{liu2022pykt}, there is no widely agreed KT baselines and published experimental comparisons become inconsistent and self-contradictory, i.e., the reported AUC scores of DKT on ASSISTments2009 range from 0.721 to 0.821 \citep{minn2018deep,yeung2018addressing}. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a strong but simple baseline method to deal with the KT task named \textsc{simpleKT}.
