To understand better this phenomenon, we examine the effect of removing position encodings on the pre-training objective itself (i.e., masked language modelling), to test whether models can reconstruct position information from co-occurrences alone.

To address these challenges, we use hypergraphs to capture evolving patterns of port scan attacks via the set of internet protocol addresses and destination ports, thereby deriving a set of hypergraph-based metrics to train a robust and resilient ensemble machine learning (ML) NIDS that effectively monitors and detects port scanning activities and adversarial intrusions while evolving intelligently in real-time.
