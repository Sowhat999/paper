HIGHLIGHT:      This paper improves the MSA by using a feature pyramid module, which enhances speaker-discriminative information of features at multiple layers via a top-down pathway and lateral connections.

42, TITLE:      Rectifying Pseudo Label Learning via Uncertainty Estimation for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03773
AUTHORS:        Zhedong Zheng ; Yi Yang
COMMENTS:       12 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables
HIGHLIGHT:      To overcome the problem, this paper proposes to explicitly estimate the prediction uncertainty during training to rectify the pseudo label learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation adaptation.

44, TITLE:      Small-Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images with End-to-End Edge-Enhanced GAN and Object Detector Network
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09085
AUTHORS:        Jakaria Rabbi ; Nilanjan Ray ; Matthias Schubert ; Subir Chowdhury ; Dennis Chao
COMMENTS:       This paper contains 27 pages and submitted to MDPI remote sensing journal (under review) GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Jakaria08/EESRGAN (Implementation)
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose an architecture with three components: ESRGAN, Edge Enhancement Network (EEN), and Detection network.

45, TITLE:      CLUE: A Chinese Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05986
AUTHORS:        Liang Xu ; Xuanwei Zhang ; Lu Li ; Hai Hu ; Chenjie Cao ; Weitang Liu ; Junyi Li ; Yudong Li ; Kai Sun ; Yechen Xu ; Yiming Cui ; Cong Yu ; Qianqian Dong ; Yin Tian ; Dian Yu ; Bo Shi ; Jun Zeng ; Rongzhao Wang ; Weijian Xie ; Yanting Li ; Yina Patterson ; Zuoyu Tian ; Yiwen Zhang ; He Zhou ; Shaoweihua Liu ; Qipeng Zhao ; Cong Yue ; Xinrui Zhang ; Zhengliang Yang ; Zhenzhong Lan
COMMENTS:       9 pages, 4 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce CLUE, a Chinese Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark. We release CLUE, baselines and pre-training dataset on Github.

46, TITLE:      Mining Commonsense Facts from the Physical World
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03149
AUTHORS:        Yanyan Zou ; Wei Lu ; Xu Sun
COMMENTS:       The experiment part is not insufficient which might confuses the readers, while we are not planning to improve it for now. To ensure the quality of arxiv papers, we would like to withdraw this submission
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a new task of mining commonsense facts from the raw text that describes the physical world. Then we create two large annotated datasets each with approximate 200k instances for commonsense knowledge base completion.

47, TITLE:      When Does Unsupervised Machine Translation Work?
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05516
AUTHORS:        Kelly Marchisio ; Kevin Duh ; Philipp Koehn
COMMENTS:       Correct typo in Table 3
HIGHLIGHT:      We find that performance rapidly deteriorates when source and target corpora are from different domains, and that random word embedding initialization can dramatically affect downstream translation performance.

48, TITLE:      Demographic Bias in Biometrics: A Survey on an Emerging Challenge
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02488
AUTHORS:        P. Drozdowski ; C. Rathgeb ; A. Dantcheva ; N. Damer ; C. Busch
COMMENTS:       15 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society. Update after first round of peer review
HIGHLIGHT:      The main contributions of this article are: (1) an overview of the topic of algorithmic bias in the context of biometrics, (2) a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on biometric bias estimation and mitigation, (3) a discussion of the pertinent technical and social matters, and (4) an outline of the remaining challenges and future work items, both from technological and social points of view.

49, TITLE:      Plug-and-play ISTA converges with kernel denoisers
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03145
AUTHORS:        Ruturaj G. Gavaskar ; Kunal N. Chaudhury
COMMENTS:       5 pages, Accepted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters
HIGHLIGHT:      We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, fixed-point convergence of PnP-ISTA is indeed guaranteed for linear inverse problems such as deblurring, inpainting and superresolution (the assumptions are verifiable for inpainting).

50, TITLE:      A white-box analysis on the writer-independent dichotomy transformation applied to offline handwritten signature verification
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03370
AUTHORS:        Victor L. F. Souza ; Adriano L. I. Oliveira ; Rafael M. O. Cruz ; Robert Sabourin
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we present a white-box analysis of this approach highlighting how it handles the challenges, the dynamic selection of references through fusion function, and its application for transfer learning.
