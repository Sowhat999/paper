CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Towards Effective and Compact Contextual Representation for Conformer Transducer Speech Recognition Systems

86, TITLE: Unsupervised Deformable Ultrasound Image Registration and Its Application for Vessel Segmentation
AUTHORS: FNU Abhimanyu ; Andrew L. Orekhov ; Ananya Bal ; John Galeotti ; Howie Choset
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a deep-learning model for deformable registration of ultrasound images at online rates, which we call U-RAFT.

87, TITLE: Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration for Respiratory Motion Compensation in Ultrasound Images
AUTHORS: FNU Abhimanyu ; Andrew L. Orekhov ; John Galeotti ; Howie Choset
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning model for deformable registration of ultrasound images and an unsupervised approach to training this model.

88, TITLE: DiffInfinite: Large Mask-Image Synthesis Via Parallel Random Patch Diffusion in Histopathology
AUTHORS: MARCO AVERSA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present DiffInfinite, a hierarchical diffusion model that generates arbitrarily large histological images while preserving long-range correlation structural information.

89, TITLE: On Sensitivity and Robustness of Normalization Schemes to Input Distribution Shifts in Automatic MR Image Diagnosis
AUTHORS: Divyam Madaan ; Daniel Sodickson ; Kyunghyun Cho ; Sumit Chopra
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The lack of robustness of these models against varying artifacts impedes their use in medical applications where safety is critical. In this work, we focus on improving the generalization performance of these models in the presence of multiple varying artifacts that manifest due to the complexity of the MR data acquisition.
