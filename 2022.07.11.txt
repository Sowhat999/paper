89, TITLE: An Infinitary Proof Theory of Linear Logic Ensuring Fair Termination in The Linear $?$-Calculus
AUTHORS: Luca Ciccone ; Luca Padovani
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Fair termination is the property of programs that may diverge "in principle" but that terminate "in practice", i.e. under suitable fairness assumptions concerning the resolution of non-deterministic choices. We study a conservative extension of $\mu$MALL$^\infty$, the infinitary proof system of the multiplicative additive fragment of linear logic with least and greatest fixed points, such that cut elimination corresponds to fair termination.

90, TITLE: Flux: Liquid Types for Rust
AUTHORS: Nico Lehmann ; Adam Geller ; Gilles Barthe ; Niki Vazou ; Ranjit Jhala
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, F.3.1; D.2.4]

91, TITLE: Copy Propagation Subsumes Constant Propagation
AUTHORS: Sreekala S. ; Vineeth Paleri
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: In literature, constant and copy propagations are considered two independent transformations requiring two different data flow analyses. Here we give a generic definition for copy propagation which enables us to view constant propagation as a particular case of copy propagation and formulate a novel data flow analysis that unifies these two transformations.

95, TITLE: FastLTS: Non-Autoregressive End-to-End Unconstrained Lip-to-Speech Synthesis
AUTHORS: Yongqi Wang ; Zhou Zhao
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.MM, eess.AS, I.2.7; I.2.10]
HIGHLIGHT: This causes cumbersome deployment and degradation of speech quality due to error propagation; 2) The audio reconstruction algorithm used by these models limits the inference speed and audio quality, while neural vocoders are not available for these models since their output spectrograms are not accurate enough; 3) The autoregressive model suffers from high inference latency, while the flow-based model has high memory occupancy: neither of them is efficient enough in both time and memory usage. To tackle these problems, we propose FastLTS, a non-autoregressive end-to-end model which can directly synthesize high-quality speech audios from unconstrained talking videos with low latency, and has a relatively small model size.
