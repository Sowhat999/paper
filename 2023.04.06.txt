92, TITLE: Efficient CNNs Via Passive Filter Pruning
AUTHORS: Arshdeep Singh ; Mark D. Plumbley
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: Under a high pruning ratio where large number of filters are to be pruned from the network, the entry-wise norm methods eliminate relatively smaller norm filters without considering the significance of the filters in producing the node output, resulting in degradation in the performance. To address this, we present a passive filter pruning method where the filters are pruned based on their contribution in producing output by considering the operator norm of the filters.

93, TITLE: Effective Theory of Transformers at Initialization

96, TITLE: AutoRL Hyperparameter Landscapes
AUTHORS: Aditya Mohan ; Carolin Benjamins ; Konrad Wienecke ; Alexander Dockhorn ; Marius Lindauer
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: Automated RL (AutoRL) addresses this difficulty, yet little is known about the dynamics of the hyperparameter landscapes that hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods traverse in search of optimal configurations. In view of existing AutoRL approaches dynamically adjusting hyperparameter configurations, we propose an approach to build and analyze these hyperparameter landscapes not just for one point in time but at multiple points in time throughout training.

AUTHORS: Nikhil Angad Bakshi ; Tejus Gupta ; Ramina Ghods ; Jeff Schneider
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
