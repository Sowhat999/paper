125, TITLE: LP-OVOD: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection By Linear Probing
AUTHORS: Chau Pham ; Truong Vu ; Khoi Nguyen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this method has a critical issue: many low-quality boxes, such as over- and under-covered-object boxes, have the same similarity score as high-quality boxes since CLIP is not trained on exact object location information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, LP-OVOD, that discards low-quality boxes by training a sigmoid linear classifier on pseudo labels retrieved from the top relevant region proposals to the novel text.

We attribute this problem to the role of the conditioning signal in inference and offer an improved sampling strategy for diffusion models that can increase generation diversity, especially at high guidance scales, with minimal loss of sample quality.
