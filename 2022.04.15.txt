AUTHORS: Angelica Tiemi Mizuno Nakamura ; Denis Fernando Wolf ; Valdir Grassi Jr
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, tasks often conflict with each other, which makes it challenging to define how the gradients of multiple tasks should be combined to allow simultaneous learning. To address this problem, we use the idea of multi-objective optimization to propose a method that takes into account temporal behaviour of the gradients to create a dynamic bias that adjust the importance of each task during the backpropagation.

101, TITLE: Multimodal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Improved Prediction of 30-day All-cause Hospital Readmission
AUTHORS: SIYI TANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent deep learning-based studies have shown promising empirical results on readmission prediction, several limitations exist that may hinder widespread clinical utility, such as (a) only patients with certain conditions are considered, (b) existing approaches do not leverage data temporality, (c) individual admissions are assumed independent of each other, which is unrealistic, (d) prior studies are usually limited to single source of data and single center data. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal, modality-agnostic spatiotemporal graph neural network (MM-STGNN) for prediction of 30-day all-cause hospital readmission that fuses multimodal in-patient longitudinal data.
