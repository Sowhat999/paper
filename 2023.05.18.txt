AUTHORS: Xiaolin Chen ; Xuemeng Song ; Yinwei Wei ; Liqiang Nie ; Tat-Seng Chua
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: Textual response generation is an essential task for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems.Although existing studies have achieved fruitful progress, they still suffer from two critical limitations: 1) focusing on the attribute knowledge but ignoring the relation knowledge that can reveal the correlations between different entities and hence promote the response generation}, and 2) only conducting the cross-entropy loss based output-level supervision but lacking the representation-level regularization. To address these limitations, we devise a novel multimodal task-oriented dialog system (named MDS-S2).
