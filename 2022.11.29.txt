AUTHORS: Yichen Jiang ; Xiang Zhou ; Mohit Bansal
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]

In this work, we analyze this behavior of seq2seq models and identify two contributing factors: a lack of mutual exclusivity bias (i.e., a source sequence already mapped to a target sequence is less likely to be mapped to other target sequences), and the tendency to memorize whole examples rather than separating structures from contents.

To address this issue, we propose a novel joint model based on BERT, which explicitly models the multiple sub-tokens features after wordpiece tokenization, thereby generating the context features that contribute to slot filling.

HIGHLIGHT: We approach the problem from a data-centric perspective, characterizing the discrepancy in environments by means of (potentially complex) transformation between their state spaces, and thus posing the problem of transfer as learning to undo this transformation. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel optimization objective based on an optimal transport distance between two distributions over trajectories -- those generated by an already-learned policy in the source domain and a learnable pushforward policy in the target domain.

We propose a transformation technique that takes as input a set of CHCs, including a set of queries, and returns as output a new set of CHCs, such that the transformed CHCs are satisfiable if and only if so are the original ones, and the transformed CHCs incorporate in each new query suitable information coming from the other ones so that the CHC satisfiability algorithm is able to exploit the relationships among all queries.
