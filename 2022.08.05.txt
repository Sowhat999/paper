HIGHLIGHT: Advances in AI based computer vision has led to a significant growth in synthetic image generation and artificial image tampering with serious implications for unethical exploitations that undermine person identification and could make render AI predictions less explainable.Morphing, Deepfake and other artificial generation of face photographs undermine the reliability of face biometrics authentication using different electronic ID documents.Morphed face photographs on e-passports can fool automated border control systems and human guards.This paper extends our previous work on using the persistent homology (PH) of texture landmarks to detect morphing attacks.We demonstrate that artificial image tampering distorts the spatial distribution of texture landmarks (i.e. their PH) as well as that of a set of image quality characteristics.We shall demonstrate that the tamper caused distortion of these two slim feature vectors provide significant potentials for building explainable (Handcrafted) tamper detectors with low error rates and suitable for implementation on constrained devices.

HIGHLIGHT: Here, we extend previous work on spike-based graph algorithms by demonstrating how symbolic and multi-relational information can be encoded using spiking neurons, allowing reasoning over symbolic structures like knowledge graphs with spiking neural networks.

82, TITLE: MAGPIE: Machine Automated General Performance Improvement Via Evolution of Software
AUTHORS: Aymeric Blot ; Justyna Petke
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose MAGPIE, a unified software improvement framework.

83, TITLE: Keyword Spotting System and Evaluation of Pruning and Quantization Methods on Low-power Edge Microcontrollers
AUTHORS: Jingyi Wang ; Shengchen Li
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.AR, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Keyword Spotting System and Evaluation of Pruning and Quantization Methods on Low-power Edge Microcontrollers

84, TITLE: Conformal Risk Control
AUTHORS: Anastasios N. Angelopoulos ; Stephen Bates ; Adam Fisch ; Lihua Lei ; Tal Schuster
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.ML, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: We extend conformal prediction to control the expected value of any monotone loss function.

85, TITLE: IT/IST/IPLeiria Response to The Call for Proposals on JPEG Pleno Point Cloud Coding
AUTHORS: ANDRÉ F. R. GUARDA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This document describes a deep learning-based point cloud geometry codec and a deep learning-based point cloud joint geometry and colour codec, submitted to the Call for Proposals on JPEG Pleno Point Cloud Coding issued in January 2022.

86, TITLE: Scalable Video Coding for Humans and Machines
AUTHORS: Hyomin Choi ; Ivan V. Baji?
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For example, machine learning models analyze surveillance video for security and traffic monitoring, search through YouTube videos for inappropriate content, and so on. In this paper, we propose a scalable video coding framework that supports machine vision (specifically, object detection) through its base layer bitstream and human vision via its enhancement layer bitstream.

87, TITLE: Multi-modal Volumetric Concept Activation to Explain Detection and Classification of Metastatic Prostate Cancer on PSMA-PET/CT
AUTHORS: ROSA C. J. KRAAIJVELD et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Hence, this study demonstrated feasibility to explain detection and classification of multi-modal volumetric data using regression concept activation.
