HIGHLIGHT: Despite its potential, rPPG methods can be susceptible to various artifacts, such as noise, occlusions, and other obstructions caused by sunglasses, masks, or even involuntary facial contact, such as individuals inadvertently touching their faces. In this study, we apply image processing transformations to intentionally degrade video quality, mimicking these challenging conditions, and subsequently evaluate the performance of both non-learning and learning-based rPPG methods on the deteriorated data.

91, TITLE: SCOPE: Structural Continuity Preservation for Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: YOUSEF YEGANEH et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In biological structures, however, organs are not separate entities; for example, in reality, a severed vessel is an indication of an underlying problem, but traditional segmentation models are not designed to strictly enforce the continuity of anatomy, potentially leading to inaccurate medical diagnoses. To address this issue, we propose a graph-based approach that enforces the continuity and connectivity of anatomical topology in medical images.

AUTHORS: AZADE FARSHAD et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While diffusion models conditioned on text prompts have produced impressive and high-quality images, accurately representing complex text prompts such as the number of instances of a specific object remains challenging. To address this limitation, we propose a novel guidance approach for the sampling process in the diffusion model that leverages bounding box and segmentation map information at inference time without additional training data.

106, TITLE: Adversary Aware Continual Learning
AUTHORS: Muhammad Umer ; Robi Polikar
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it has been shown that such approaches are extremely vulnerable to the adversarial backdoor attacks, where an intelligent adversary can introduce small amount of misinformation to the model in the form of imperceptible backdoor pattern during training to cause deliberate forgetting of a specific task or class at test time. In this work, we propose a novel defensive framework to counter such an insidious attack where, we use the attacker's primary strength-hiding the backdoor pattern by making it imperceptible to humans-against it, and propose to learn a perceptible (stronger) pattern (also during the training) that can overpower the attacker's imperceptible (weaker) pattern.

116, TITLE: Quantum Control Machine: The Limits of Quantum Programs As Data
AUTHORS: Charles Yuan ; Agnes Villanyi ; Michael Carbin
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.AR, quant-ph]

In this work, we identify that an alternative model to enable a program counter in superposition faces an obstacle -- no such machine can correctly support control flow constructs with non-injective semantics, including the conventional conditional jump.

Thus, we propose a new feature selection methodology for regression problems that takes this fact into account, using Shapley values to study the effect that each variable has on the predictions.
