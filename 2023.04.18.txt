HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) method based on a latent space constructed by a siamese patch-based auto-encoder and perform the outlier detection with a One-Class SVM training paradigm tailored to the lesion detection task in multi-modality neuroimaging.

244, TITLE: Deep-Learning-based Vascularture Extraction for Single-Scan Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography
AUTHORS: Jinpeng Liao ; Tianyu Zhang ; Yilong Zhang ; Chunhui Li ; Zhihong Huang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose a vasculature extraction pipeline that uses only one-repeated OCT scan to generate OCTA images.

245, TITLE: Morph-SSL: Self-Supervision with Longitudinal Morphing to Predict AMD Progression from OCT
AUTHORS: ARUNAVA CHAKRAVARTY et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although eye clinics generate vast amounts of longitudinal OCT scans to monitor AMD progression, only a small subset can be manually labeled for supervised DL. To address this issue, we propose Morph-SSL, a novel Self-supervised Learning (SSL) method for longitudinal data.

246, TITLE: Towards Tumour Graph Learning for Survival Prediction in Head & Neck Cancer Patients
AUTHORS: Angel Victor Juanco Muller ; Joao F. C. Mota ; Keith A. Goatman ; Corne Hoogendoorn
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, automated segmentation and prognosis estimation approaches can help ensure each patient gets the most effective treatment. This paper presents a framework to perform these functions on arbitrary field of view (FoV) PET and CT registered scans, thus approaching tasks 1 and 2 of the HECKTOR 2022 challenge as team \texttt{VokCow}.

247, TITLE: Translating Simulation Images to X-ray Images Via Multi-Scale Semantic Matching
AUTHORS: JINGXUAN KANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a new method to translate simulation images from an endovascular simulator to X-ray images.
