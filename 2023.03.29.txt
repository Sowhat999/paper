To address these problems, we develop a novel synthetic method to simulate 4K hazy images (including nighttime and daytime scenes) from clear images, which first estimates the scene depth, simulates the light rays and object reflectance, then migrates the synthetic images to real domains by using a GAN, and finally yields the hazy effects on 4K resolution images.

114, TITLE: Deep Incomplete Multi-view Clustering with Cross-view Partial Sample and Prototype Alignment
AUTHORS: Jiaqi Jin ; Siwei Wang ; Zhibin Dong ; Xinwang Liu ; En Zhu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although several attempts have been proposed to address IMVC, they suffer from the following drawbacks: i) Existing methods mainly adopt cross-view contrastive learning forcing the representations of each sample across views to be exactly the same, which might ignore view discrepancy and flexibility in representations; ii) Due to the absence of non-observed samples across multiple views, the obtained prototypes of clusters might be unaligned and biased, leading to incorrect fusion. To address the above issues, we propose a Cross-view Partial Sample and Prototype Alignment Network (CPSPAN) for Deep Incomplete Multi-view Clustering.

HIGHLIGHT: A well-known characteristic of natural images is that most patches are smooth, while high-content patches like textures or repetitive patterns are much rarer, which results in a long-tailed distribution. This distribution can create an inductive bias when training machine learning algorithms for image restoration tasks and for image demosaicing in particular.
