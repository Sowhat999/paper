CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose a cross-domain unsupervised reconstruction (CDUR) strategy with a pure transformer model, which overcomes the lack of ground truth labels from limited PA measurements.

83, TITLE: Mixed Attention with Deep Supervision for Delineation of COVID Infection in Lung CT
AUTHORS: Pallabi Dutta ; Sushmita Mitra
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Mixed Attention with Deep Supervision for Delineation of COVID Infection in Lung CT

84, TITLE: Self-supervised Domain Adaptation for Breaking The Limits of Low-quality Fundus Image Quality Enhancement
AUTHORS: QINGSHAN HOU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we tackle image quality enhancement in a fully unsupervised setting, i.e., neither paired images nor high-quality images.

85, TITLE: Acute Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation in Non-contrast CT Images Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
AUTHORS: A. V. DOBSHIK et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, an automatic algorithm aimed at volumetric segmentation of acute ischemic stroke lesion in non-contrast computed tomography brain 3D images is proposed.

86, TITLE: Multi Kernel Positional Embedding ConvNeXt for Polyp Segmentation
AUTHORS: Trong-Hieu Nguyen Mau ; Quoc-Huy Trinh ; Nhat-Tan Bui ; Minh-Triet Tran ; Hai-Dang Nguyen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the simple skip connection scheme in UNet leads to deficient context information and the semantic gap between feature maps from the encoder and decoder. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework composed of ConvNeXt backbone and Multi Kernel Positional Embedding block.
