We tackle these challenges by first investigating rich sets of data collected from a real-world shared e-mobility system for one year, analyzing the operation model, usage patterns and expansion dynamics of this new mobility mode.

Specifically, we present the Predictive Processing Proximal Policy Optimization (P4O) agent; an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent that applies predictive processing to a recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm by integrating a world model in its hidden state.

CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Automated identification of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance images (LGE-CMR) is limited by image noise and artifacts such as those related to motion and partial volume effect. This paper presents a novel joint deep learning (JDL) framework that improves such tasks by utilizing simultaneously learned myocardium segmentations to eliminate negative effects from non-region-of-interest areas.
