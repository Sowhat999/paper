82, TITLE: Class Is Invariant to Context and Vice Versa: On Learning Invariance for Out-Of-Distribution Generalization
AUTHORS: Jiaxin Qi ; Kaihua Tang ; Qianru Sun ; Xian-Sheng Hua ; Hanwang Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In contrast, we point out the everoverlooked other side of the above principle: context is also invariant to class, which motivates us to consider the classes (which are already labeled) as the varying environments to resolve context bias (without context labels). We implement this idea by minimizing the contrastive loss of intra-class sample similarity while assuring this similarity to be invariant across all classes.

AUTHORS: Samah Khawaled ; Moti Freiman
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce "NPB-REC", a non-parametric fully Bayesian framework for uncertainty assessment in MRI reconstruction from undersampled "k-space" data.

164, TITLE: Deep Learning-enabled Spatial Phase Unwrapping for 3D Measurement
AUTHORS: Xiaolong Luo ; Wanzhong Song ; Songlin Bai ; Yu Li ; Zhihe Zhao
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.5]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a hybrid method combining deep learning and traditional path-following for robust SPU in FPP.

165, TITLE: Exploring Long & Short Range Temporal Information for Learned Video Compression
AUTHORS: Huairui Wang ; Zhenzhong Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we focus on exploiting the unique characteristics of video content and further exploring temporal information to enhance compression performance.

166, TITLE: Distributed Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Yawen Wu ; Dewen Zeng ; Zhepeng Wang ; Yiyu Shi ; Jingtong Hu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose two federated self-supervised learning frameworks for volumetric medical image segmentation with limited annotations.

167, TITLE: Data-centric AI Approach to Improve Optic Nerve Head Segmentation and Localization in OCT En Face Images
AUTHORS: THOMAS SCHLEGL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we follow a data-centric approach to optimize classifier training for optic nerve head detection and localization in optical coherence tomography en face images of the retina.

168, TITLE: Continual Learning for Tumor Classification in Histopathology Images
AUTHORS: VEENA KAUSTABAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose CL scenarios in DP settings, where histopathology image data from different sources/distributions arrive sequentially, the knowledge of which is integrated into a single model without training all the data from scratch.

169, TITLE: Seamless Iterative Semi-Supervised Correction of Imperfect Labels in Microscopy Images
AUTHORS: MARAWAN ELBATEL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Due to the nature of missing bounding boxes in the pseudo labels, which would negatively affect the training, we propose to train on dynamically generated synthetic-like images using seamless cloning.
