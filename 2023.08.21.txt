HIGHLIGHT: While existing methods perform well when the dataset for pre-training is structurally similar to the target dataset, the approaches suffer from training instabilities or memorization issues when the objects in the two domains have a very different structure. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a new smoothness similarity regularization that transfers the inherently learned smoothness of the pre-trained GAN to the few-shot target domain even if the two domains are very different.

To be more robust to errors and accelerate this 3D EBSD data collection, we introduce a two step method that recovers missing slices in an 3D EBSD volume, using an efficient transformer model and a projection algorithm to process the transformer's outputs.

AUTHORS: PENG XIANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, most previous methods suffered from ambiguous region features or failed to refine per-point features effectively, which leads to information loss and ambiguous semantic identification. To resolve this, we propose Retro-FPN to model the per-point feature prediction as an explicit and retrospective refining process, which goes through all the pyramid layers to extract semantic features explicitly for each point.
