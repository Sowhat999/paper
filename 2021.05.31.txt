98, TITLE: Reflections on Termination of Linear Loops
AUTHORS: Shaowei Zhu ; Zachary Kincaid
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Combining the two, we develop a monotone conditional termination analysis for general loops.

99, TITLE: Model Repair Revamped: On The Automated Synthesis of Markov Chains
AUTHORS: Milan Ceska ; Christian Dehnert ; Nils Jansen ; Sebastian Junges ; Joost-Pieter Katoen
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, 68N30]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper outlines two approaches|based on counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS), respectively to the automated synthesis of finite-state probabilistic models and programs.

100, TITLE: Gobra: Modular Specification and Verification of Go Programs (extended Version)
AUTHORS: FELIX A. WOLF et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We present Gobra, a modular, deductive program verifier for Go that proves memory safety, crash safety, data-race freedom, and user-provided specifications.

101, TITLE: A Proxemics Game Between Festival Visitors and An Industrial Robot
AUTHORS: Brigitte Krenn ; Stephanie Gross ; Bernhard Dieber ; Horst Pichler ; Kathrin Meyer
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We recorded video data of these interactions and investigated general nonverbal behaviours of the humans interacting with the robot, as well as nonverbal behaviours of people in the audience.

102, TITLE: Model Selection for Production System Via Automated Online Experiments
AUTHORS: Zhenwen Dai ; Praveen Chandar ; Ghazal Fazelnia ; Ben Carterette ; Mounia Lalmas-Roelleke
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose an automated online experimentation mechanism that can efficiently perform model selection from a large pool of models with a small number of online experiments.

AUTHORS: Songxiang Liu ; Yuewen Cao ; Dan Su ; Helen Meng
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose DiffSVC, an SVC system based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model.

104, TITLE: A Systematic Review of Transfer Learning Based Approaches for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
AUTHORS: Burcu Oltu ; Bü?ra Kübra Karaca ; Hamit Erdem ; Atilla Özgür
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
