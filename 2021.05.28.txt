HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose a new hybrid approach that evolves CPPNs first, but allows the latent vectors to evolve later, and combines the benefits of both approaches.

90, TITLE: Robust Navigation for Racing Drones Based on Imitation Learning and Modularization
AUTHORS: Tianqi Wang ; Dong Eui Chang
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a vision-based modularized drone racing navigation system that uses a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) for the perception module to produce high-level navigation commands and then leverages a state-of-the-art planner and controller to generate low-level control commands, thus exploiting the advantages of both data-based and model-based approaches.

91, TITLE: Finding Top Performers Through Email Patterns Analysis
AUTHORS: Q. Wen ; P. A. Gloor ; A. Fronzetti Colladon ; P. Tickoo ; T. Joshi
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL, physics.soc-ph, J.4; I.2.7; H.4.0]
HIGHLIGHT: To better explore the predictive power of the email indicators, we employed AdaBoost machine learning models, which achieved 83.56% accuracy in identifying top performers.

92, TITLE: Implementation of Live Reverse Debugging in LLDB
AUTHORS: Anthony Savidis ; Vangelis Tsiatsianas
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We consider live reverse debuggers both challenging and promising, since they can fit into existing forward debuggers, and we developed the first live reverse debugger on top of LLDB, discussing in detail our implementation approach.

93, TITLE: XOmiVAE: An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Cancer Classification Using High-dimensional Omics Data
AUTHORS: Eloise Withnell ; Xiaoyu Zhang ; Kai Sun ; Yike Guo
CATEGORY: q-bio.GN [q-bio.GN, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: Here we present XOmiVAE, a novel interpretable deep learning model for cancer classification using high-dimensional omics data.

94, TITLE: HDRUNet: Single Image HDR Reconstruction with Denoising and Dequantization
AUTHORS: Xiangyu Chen ; Yihao Liu ; Zhengwen Zhang ; Yu Qiao ; Chao Dong
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a novel learning-based approach using a spatially dynamic encoder-decoder network, HDRUNet, to learn an end-to-end mapping for single image HDR reconstruction with denoising and dequantization.

95, TITLE: Efficient High-Resolution Image-to-Image Translation Using Multi-Scale Gradient U-Net
AUTHORS: Kumarapu Laxman ; Shiv Ram Dubey ; Baddam Kalyan ; Satya Raj Vineel Kojjarapu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Gradient based U-Net (MSG U-Net) model for high-resolution image-to-image translation up to 2048X1024 resolution.

96, TITLE: Cardiac Segmentation on CT Images Through Shape-Aware Contour Attentions
AUTHORS: Sanguk Park ; Minyoung Chung
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, to improve the segmentation accuracy between proximate organs, we introduce a novel model to exploit shape and boundary-aware features.
