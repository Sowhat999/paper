129, TITLE:     Projected Neural Network for a Class of Sparse Regression with Cardinality Penalty
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00858
AUTHORS:        Wenjing Li ; Wei Bian
COMMENTS:       In the third numerical experiment of these two versions, the data of the two functions SCAD and MCP were incorrect. The derivative of these two functions should be brought in the experiment, but we brought these functions themselves. In addition, the projection neural network is more accurate than projected neural network in terms of academic expression, so we have changed the title of the paper
