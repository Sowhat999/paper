AUTHORS: Weiyuan Li ; Bin Dai ; Ziyi Zhou ; Qi Yao ; Baoyuan Wang

AUTHORS: FANQING MENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although recent-advanced approaches employed lightweight metrics to measure models' transferability,they often depend heavily on the prior knowledge of a single task, making them inapplicable in a multi-modal multi-task scenario. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient multi-task model selector (EMMS), which employs large-scale foundation models to transform diverse label formats such as categories, texts, and bounding boxes of different downstream tasks into a unified noisy label embedding.
