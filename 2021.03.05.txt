AUTHORS: Shiyao Guo ; Yuxia Sheng ; Shenpeng Li ; Li Chai ; Jingxin Zhang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To reduce the reconstruction error and the sensitivity to iteration number, we present a general class of multi-kernel matrices and two regularizers consisting of kernel image dictionary and kernel image Laplacian quatradic, and use them to derive the single-kernel regularized EM and multi-kernel regularized EM algorithms for PET image reconstruction.
