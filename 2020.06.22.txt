Since the geometric complexity of a local spatio-temporal patch of a deforming non-rigid object is often simple enough to be faithfully represented with a parametric model, we artificially generate a database of small deforming rectangular meshes rendered with different material properties and light conditions, along with their corresponding depth videos, and use such data to train a convolutional neural network.

HIGHLIGHT:      We present a non-commutative algorithm for the multiplication of a 2x2-block-matrix by its transpose using 5 block products (3 recursive calls and 2 general products) over C or any finite field.We use geometric considerations on the space of bilinear forms describing 2x2 matrix products to obtain this algorithm and we show how to reduce the number of involved additions.The resulting algorithm for arbitrary dimensions is a reduction of multiplication of a matrix by its transpose to general matrix product, improving by a constant factor previously known reductions.Finally we propose schedules with low memory footprint that support a fast and memory efficient practical implementation over a finite field.To conclude, we show how to use our result in LDLT factorization.
