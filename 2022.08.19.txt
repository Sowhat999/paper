HIGHLIGHT: This paper describes the solution of Team 88VIP, which mainly comprises two types of models: a gradient boosting decision tree to memorize the basic data patterns and a recurrent neural network to capture the deep and latent probabilistic transitions.

87, TITLE: Neural Payoff Machines: Predicting Fair and Stable Payoff Allocations Among Team Members
AUTHORS: Daphne Cornelisse ; Thomas Rood ; Mateusz Malinowski ; Yoram Bachrach ; Tal Kachman
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.MA, econ.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we show how cooperative game-theoretic solutions can be distilled into a learned model by training neural networks to propose fair and stable payoff allocations.

88, TITLE: The First Mathematical Proof That Crossover Gives Super-Constant Performance Gains For The NSGA-II
AUTHORS: Benjamin Doerr ; Zhongdi Qu
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.DS]
HIGHLIGHT: Continuing this research direction, we prove that the NSGA-II optimizes the OneJumpZeroJump benchmark asymptotically faster when crossover is employed.

89, TITLE: Complete Stream Fusion for Software-Defined Radio
AUTHORS: Tomoaki Kobayashi ; Oleg Kiselyov
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, D.3.4; D.3.3]
HIGHLIGHT: We report using the SDR benchmark -- specifically, FM Radio reception -- to evaluate the recently developed single-thread stream processing library strymonas, contrasting it with the synchronous dataflow system StreamIt.

90, TITLE: Intention Estimation from Gaze and Motion Features for Human-robot Shared-control Object Manipulation
AUTHORS: Anna Belardinelli ; Anirudh Reddy Kondapally ; Dirk Ruiken ; Daniel Tanneberg ; Tomoki Watabe
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, an intention estimation framework is presented, which uses natural gaze and motion features to predict the current action and the target object.

91, TITLE: Stable Object Reorientation Using Contact Plane Registration
AUTHORS: Richard Li ; Carlos Esteves ; Ameesh Makadia ; Pulkit Agrawal
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a system for accurately predicting stable orientations for diverse rigid objects.

92, TITLE: CP-PINNs: Changepoints Detection in PDEs Using Physics Informed Neural Networks with Total-Variation Penalty
AUTHORS: Zhikang Dong ; Pawel Polak
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NA, math.DS, math.NA]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose an additional refinement algorithm that combines changepoints detection with a reduced dynamic programming method that is feasible for the computationally intensive PINNs methods, and we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model empirically using examples of different equations with changes in the parameters.
