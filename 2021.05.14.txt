CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect and reconstruct cracks in concrete structures using vision-guided active tactile perception.

92, TITLE: A Hybrid Machine Learning/deep Learning COVID-19 Severity Predictive Model from CT Images and Clinical Data
AUTHORS: MATTEO CHIEREGATO et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: The model aims to provide clinical decision support to medical doctors, with the probability score of belonging to an outcome class and with case-based SHAP interpretation of features importance.

93, TITLE: TopoTxR: A Topological Biomarker for Predicting Treatment Response in Breast Cancer
AUTHORS: Fan Wang ; Saarthak Kapse ; Steven Liu ; Prateek Prasanna ; Chao Chen
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel method to direct a neural network's attention to a dedicated set of voxels surrounding biologically relevant tissue structures.

94, TITLE: End-to-End Sequential Sampling and Reconstruction for MR Imaging
AUTHORS: TIANWEI YIN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we leverage the sequential nature of MRI measurements, and propose a fully differentiable framework that jointly learns a sequential sampling policy simultaneously with a reconstruction strategy.

95, TITLE: The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) Challenge
AUTHORS: SARTHAK PATI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This manuscript describes the first challenge on Federated Learning, namely the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) challenge 2021. Towards alleviating these concerns, we are proposing the FeTS challenge 2021 to cater towards both the development and the evaluation of models for the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous (in appearance, shape, and histology) brain tumors, namely gliomas.

96, TITLE: HINet: Half Instance Normalization Network for Image Restoration
AUTHORS: Liangyu Chen ; Xin Lu ; Jie Zhang ; Xiaojie Chu ; Chengpeng Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we explore the role of Instance Normalization in low-level vision tasks.

97, TITLE: Removing Blocking Artifacts in Video Streams Using Event Cameras
AUTHORS: Henry H. Chopp ; Srutarshi Banerjee ; Oliver Cossairt ; Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose EveRestNet, a convolutional neural network designed to remove blocking artifacts in videostreams using events from neuromorphic sensors.

98, TITLE: DONet: Dual-Octave Network for Fast MR Image Reconstruction
AUTHORS: CHUN-MEI FENG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisition is an inherently prolonged process, whose acceleration has long been the subject of research.
