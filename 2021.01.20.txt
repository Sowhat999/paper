HIGHLIGHT: We consider the multi-target detection problem of estimating a two-dimensional target image from a large noisy measurement image that contains many randomly rotated and translated copies of the target image.

AUTHORS: Khalid L. Alsamadony ; Ertugrul U. Yildirim ; Guenther Glatz ; Umair bin Waheed ; Sherif M. Hanafy
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To address the aforementioned issues, we apply DCNNs to improve the quality of rock CT images and reduce exposure times by more than 60\%, simultaneously.

AUTHORS: Hanliang Jiang ; Fuhao Shen ; Fei Gao ; Weidong Han
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To combat these challenges, in this work, we aim to build an efficient and (partially) explainable classification model.

91, TITLE: Using StyleGAN for Visual Interpretability of Deep Learning Models on Medical Images
AUTHORS: Kathryn Schutte ; Olivier Moindrot ; Paul Hérent ; Jean-Baptiste Schiratti ; Simon Jégou
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a new interpretability method that can be used to understand the predictions of any black-box model on images, by showing how the input image would be modified in order to produce different predictions.
