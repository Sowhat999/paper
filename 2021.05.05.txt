HIGHLIGHT: We propose a new method to estimate causal effects from nonexperimental data.

86, TITLE: COVID-Net CT-S: 3D Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for COVID-19 Severity Assessment Using Chest CT Images
AUTHORS: Hossein Aboutalebi ; Saad Abbasi ; Mohammad Javad Shafiee ; Alexander Wong
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Motivated by this challenge, we introduce COVID-Net CT-S, a suite of deep convolutional neural networks for predicting lung disease severity due to COVID-19 infection.

87, TITLE: Weakly-Supervised Universal Lesion Segmentation with Regional Level Set Loss
AUTHORS: YOUBAO TANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a novel weakly-supervised universal lesion segmentation method by building an attention enhanced model based on the High-Resolution Network (HRNet), named AHRNet, and propose a regional level set (RLS) loss for optimizing lesion boundary delineation.

88, TITLE: Automated Estimation of Total Lung Volume Using Chest Radiographs and Deep Learning
AUTHORS: ECEM SOGANCIOGLU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we investigate the performance of several deep-learning approaches for automated measurement of total lung volume from chest radiographs.

89, TITLE: Event Camera Simulator Design for Modeling Attention-based Inference Architectures
AUTHORS: Md Jubaer Hossain Pantho ; Joel Mandebi Mbongue ; Pankaj Bhowmik ; Christophe Bobda
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents an event camera simulator that can be a potent tool for hardware design prototyping, parameter optimization, attention-based innovative algorithm development, and benchmarking.
