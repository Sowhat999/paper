AUTHORS: Ido Benbaji ; Omri Doron ; Adèle Hénot-Mortier
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Proponents of the Distributed Morphology framework have posited the existence of two levels of morphological word formation: a lower one, leading to loose input-output semantic relationships; and an upper one, leading to tight input-output semantic relationships. In this work, we propose to test the validity of this assumption in the context of Hebrew word embeddings.

12, TITLE: Assessing The Unitary RNN As An End-to-End Compositional Model of Syntax
AUTHORS: Jean-Philippe Bernardy ; Shalom Lappin
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that both an LSTM and a unitary-evolution recurrent neural network (URN) can achieve encouraging accuracy on two types of syntactic patterns: context-free long distance agreement, and mildly context-sensitive cross serial dependencies.

13, TITLE: The Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus
AUTHORS: JACKSON TRAGER et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.CY, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To facilitate improving our understanding of the role of moral rhetoric, we present the Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus, a collection of 16,123 Reddit comments that have been curated from 12 distinct subreddits, hand-annotated by at least three trained annotators for 8 categories of moral sentiment (i.e., Care, Proportionality, Equality, Purity, Authority, Loyalty, Thin Morality, Implicit/Explicit Morality) based on the updated Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) framework.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cond-mat.mtrl-sci]
HIGHLIGHT: In NLP, assignment of high-dimensional vectors, known as embeddings, to passages of text preserves the syntactic and semantic relationship between words. Embeddings rely on machine learning algorithms and in the present work, we have employed the Word2Vec model, previously explored by others, and the BERT model - applying them towards a unique challenge in materials engineering.

16, TITLE: ARMANI: Part-level Garment-Text Alignment for Unified Cross-Modal Fashion Design
AUTHORS: XUJIE ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To facilitate accurate generation, cross-modal synthesis methods typically rely on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to align textual and garment information. In this work, we argue that simply aligning texture and garment information is not sufficient to capture the semantics of the visual information and therefore propose MaskCLIP.

17, TITLE: Patching Open-vocabulary Models By Interpolating Weights
AUTHORS: GABRIEL ILHARCO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We study model patching, where the goal is to improve accuracy on specific tasks without degrading accuracy on tasks where performance is already adequate.

AUTHORS: Neel Trivedi ; Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: Further, conventional approaches employ independent modality streams (e.g. joint, bone, joint velocity, bone velocity) and train their network multiple times on these streams, which massively increases the number of training parameters. To address these issues, we introduce PSUMNet, a novel approach for scalable and efficient pose-based action recognition.

25, TITLE: PPMN: Pixel-Phrase Matching Network for One-Stage Panoptic Narrative Grounding
AUTHORS: ZIHAN DING et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the two-stage pipeline usually suffers from the performance limitation of low-quality proposals in the first stage and the loss of spatial details caused by region feature pooling, as well as complicated strategies designed for things and stuff categories separately. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose a one-stage end-to-end Pixel-Phrase Matching Network (PPMN), which directly matches each phrase to its corresponding pixels instead of region proposals and outputs panoptic segmentation by simple combination.

To solve this problem, we propose Attentive-Diversity Attack (ADA), which disrupts diverse salient features in a stochastic manner to improve transferability.

29, TITLE: Optimal Transport Features for Morphometric Population Analysis
AUTHORS: SAMUEL GERBER et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, eess.IV, q-bio.QM, I.4.9; J.3; I.5.2]

30, TITLE: PointTree: Transformation-Robust Point Cloud Encoder with Relaxed K-D Trees
AUTHORS: Jun-Kun Chen ; Yu-Xiong Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite rapid progress, state-of-the-art encoders are restrictive to canonicalized point clouds, and have weaker than necessary performance when encountering geometric transformation distortions. To overcome this challenge, we propose PointTree, a general-purpose point cloud encoder that is robust to transformations based on relaxed K-D trees.

31, TITLE: Locality-aware Attention Network with Discriminative Dynamics Learning for Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection
AUTHORS: Yujiang Pu ; Xiaoyu Wu

AUTHORS: ZHUO-XU CUI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the existing UNN-based approach does not fully use the MR image physical priors, resulting in poor performance in some common scenarios (e.g., partial Fourier, regular sampling, etc.) and the lack of theoretical guarantees for reconstruction accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a safeguarded k-space interpolation method for MRI using a specially designed UNN with a tripled architecture driven by three physical priors of the MR images (or k-space data), including sparsity, coil sensitivity smoothness, and phase smoothness.

34, TITLE: Hybrid Transformer Network for Deepfake Detection

In this work, we tackle these issues by (a) providing large-scale demographic and non-demographic attribute annotations of 41 different attributes for five popular DeepFake datasets and (b) comprehensively analysing AI-bias of multiple state-of-the-art DeepFake detection models on these databases.

38, TITLE: Unsupervised Face Morphing Attack Detection Via Self-paced Anomaly Detection
AUTHORS: Meiling Fang ; Fadi Boutros ; Naser Damer
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, given variations in the morphing attacks, the performance of supervised MAD solutions drops significantly due to the insufficient diversity and quantity of the existing MAD datasets. To address this concern, we propose a completely unsupervised MAD solution via self-paced anomaly detection (SPL-MAD) by leveraging the existing large-scale face recognition (FR) datasets and the unsupervised nature of convolutional autoencoders.

AUTHORS: Inan Evin ; Perttu Hämäläinen ; Christian Guckelsberger
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI, cs.MM]

AUTHORS: SHUVENDU K. LAHIRI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.LG, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: In fact, it is hard to define a notion of correctness since natural language can be ambiguous and lacks a formal semantics. In this paper, we take a first step towards addressing the problem above by proposing the workflow of test-driven user-intent formalization (TDUIF), which leverages lightweight user feedback to jointly (a) formalize the user intent as tests (a partial specification), and (b) generates code that meets the formal user intent.

68, TITLE: ROC: A New Paradigm for Lyric-to-Melody Generation
AUTHORS: Ang Lv ; Xu Tan ; Tao Qin ; Tie-Yan Liu ; Rui Yan
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.MM, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: These characteristics cannot be well handled by neural generation models that learn lyric-to-melody mapping in an end-to-end way, due to several issues: (1) lack of aligned lyric-melody training data to sufficiently learn lyric-melody feature alignment; (2) lack of controllability in generation to explicitly guarantee the lyric-melody feature alignment. In this paper, we propose ROC, a new paradigm for lyric-to-melody generation that addresses the above issues through a generation-retrieval pipeline.
