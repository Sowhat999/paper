http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11457
AUTHORS:        Alceu Bissoto ; Eduardo Valle ; Sandra Avila
COMMENTS:       Accepted to the ISIC Skin Image Analysis Workshop @ CVPR 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work we address this issue for skin-lesion classification models, with two objectives: finding out what are the spurious correlations exploited by biased networks, and debiasing the models by removing such spurious correlations from them. We perform a systematic integrated analysis of 7 visual artifacts (which are possible sources of biases exploitable by networks), employ a state-of-the-art technique to prevent the models from learning spurious correlations, and propose datasets to test models for the presence of bias.

COMMENTS:       Rectifiy some typos in Arxiv title
HIGHLIGHT:      Unlike previous methods which are composed of multiple offline stages, we propose Sequential Label Propagation and Enhancement Networks (referred as Label-PEnet) that progressively transform image-level labels to pixel-wise labels in a coarse-to-fine manner.

AUTHORS:        Matthew Schlegel ; Andrew Jacobsen ; Muhammad Zaheer ; Andrew Patterson ; Adam White ; Martha White
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we explore how to use multi-step predictions, as a simple and general approach to inject prior knowledge, while retaining much of the generality and learning power behind RNNs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02733
AUTHORS:        Xue Mengge ; Yu Bowen ; Liu Tingwen ; Wang Bin ; Meng Erli ; Li Quangang
COMMENTS:       9 pages, 4 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a porous lattice-based transformer encoder for Chinese named entity recognition, which is capable to better exploit the GPU parallelism and batch the computation owing to the mask mechanism in transformer.

46, TITLE:      Social Bias Frames: Reasoning about Social and Power Implications of Language
http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03891
AUTHORS:        Maarten Sap ; Saadia Gabriel ; Lianhui Qin ; Dan Jurafsky ; Noah A. Smith ; Yejin Choi
COMMENTS:       ACL 2020 Camera Ready; Data available at http://tinyurl.com/social-bias-frames
HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups.

HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework called LC-ST-FCN (locally connected spatiotemporal fully-convolutional neural network) to address the unique challenges of the region-level demand forecasting problem within one end-to-end architecture (E2E).
