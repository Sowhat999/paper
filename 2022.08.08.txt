85, TITLE: Covariant-Contravariant Refinement Modal $?$-calculus
AUTHORS: Huili Xing
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.CL, cs.FL]
HIGHLIGHT: The notion of covariant-contravariant refinement (CC-refinement, for short) is a generalization of the notions of bisimulation, simulation and refinement. This paper introduces CC-refinement modal $\mu$-calculus (CCRML$^{\mu}$) obtained from the modal $\mu$-calculus system K$^{\mu}$ by adding CC-refinement quantifiers, establishes an axiom system for CCRML$^{\mu}$ and explores the important properties: soundness, completeness and decidability of this axiom system.

CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Adversarial attacks offer a valuable tool to understand possible failure modes and worst case performance of DL-based reconstruction algorithms.

AUTHORS: Shiyi Wang ; Guang Yang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In COVID-19 computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs, ground glass turbidity is the most common finding that requires specialist diagnosis. Based on this situation, some researchers propose the relevant DL models which can replace professional diagnostic specialists in clinics when lacking expertise.
