110, TITLE: Label Refinement Network from Synthetic Error Augmentation for Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: SHUAI CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Deep convolutional neural networks for image segmentation do not learn the label structure explicitly and may produce segmentations with an incorrect structure, e.g., with disconnected cylindrical structures in the segmentation of tree-like structures such as airways or blood vessels. In this paper, we propose a novel label refinement method to correct such errors from an initial segmentation, implicitly incorporating information about label structure.
