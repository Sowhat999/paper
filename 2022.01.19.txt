HIGHLIGHT: To solve it, we propose a frequent itemset-driven search approach, which integrates the concept of frequent itemset mining in data mining into the well-known memetic search framework.

92, TITLE: BINGO: Pinpointing Concurrency Bugs in Go Via Binary
AUTHORS: Chongxin Zhong ; Qidong Zhao ; Xu Liu
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: BINGO correlates binary execution with Go semantics and employs novel bug detection algorithms.

93, TITLE: Inducing Structure in Reward Learning By Learning Features
AUTHORS: Andreea Bobu ; Marius Wiggert ; Claire Tomlin ; Anca D. Dragan
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce a novel type of human input for teaching features and an algorithm that utilizes it to learn complex features from the raw state space.

94, TITLE: Representation Learning on Heterostructures Via Heterogeneous Anonymous Walks
AUTHORS: XUAN GUO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI, 68T30, J.4.3]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we try to take the first step for representation learning on heterostructures, which is very challenging due to their highly diverse combinations of node types and underlying structures.

95, TITLE: Lifelong Dynamic Optimization for Self-Adaptive Systems: Fact or Fiction?
AUTHORS: Tao Chen
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose LiDOS, a lifelong dynamic optimization framework for SAS planning.

96, TITLE: A Knowledge-driven Business Process Analysis Canvas
AUTHORS: Michele Missikoff
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, H.4.1; D.2.2; D.2.3; D.2.6; D.2.9]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose the Business Process Analysis Canvas, a knowledge framework organized in eight knowledge sections aimed at supporting the business expert in carrying out the analysis, eventually yielding a BP analysis Ontology.

97, TITLE: Human and Automatic Speech Recognition Performance on German Oral History Interviews
AUTHORS: Michael Gref ; Nike Matthiesen ; Christoph Schmidt ; Sven Behnke ; Joachim Köhler
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In the present work, we investigate how large this gap between human and machine transcription still is.

98, TITLE: A Study on The Ambiguity in Human Annotation of German Oral History Interviews for Perceived Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis
AUTHORS: MICHAEL GREF et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper investigates the ambiguity in human perception of emotions and sentiment in German oral history interviews and the impact on machine learning systems.

99, TITLE: Joint Denoising and HDR for RAW Video Sequences
AUTHORS: A. Buades ; O. Martorell ; M. Sánchez-Beeckman
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a patch-based method for the simultaneous denoising and fusion of a sequence of RAW multi-exposed images.

100, TITLE: Deep Equilibrium Models for Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging
AUTHORS: Yaping Zhao ; Siming Zheng ; Xin Yuan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose deep equilibrium models (DEQ) for video SCI, fusing data-driven regularization and stable convergence in a theoretically sound manner.
