AUTHORS:        Kai Xiao ; Logan Engstrom ; Andrew Ilyas ; Aleksander Madry
HIGHLIGHT:      We create a toolkit for disentangling foreground and background signal on ImageNet images, and find that (a) models can achieve non-trivial accuracy by relying on the background alone, (b) models often misclassify images even in the presence of correctly classified foregrounds--up to 87.5% of the time with adversarially chosen backgrounds, and (c) more accurate models tend to depend on backgrounds less.
