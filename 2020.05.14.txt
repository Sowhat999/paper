HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we detail the principles that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce the pipeline of it, through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users to achieve their customization purpose, and it's noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could achieve results with high fidelity and indeed indiscernible by mainstream forgery detection approaches.
