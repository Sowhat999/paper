HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we are investigating explainable landscape-aware regression models where the contribution of each landscape feature to the prediction of the optimization algorithm performance is estimated on a global and local level.

91, TITLE: Automatic Guide Generation for Stan Via NumPyro
AUTHORS: Guillaume Baudart ; Louis Mandel
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show that using our recently proposed compiler from Stan to Pyro, Stan users can easily try the set of algorithms implemented in Pyro for black-box variational inference.

92, TITLE: CNN-based Omnidirectional Object Detection for HermesBot Autonomous Delivery Robot with Preliminary Frame Classification
AUTHORS: SAIAN PROTASOV et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In our work, we propose an algorithm for optimizing a neural network for object detection using preliminary binary frame classification.

93, TITLE: ModEL: A Modularized End-to-end Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Driving
AUTHORS: GUAN WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce a new modularized end-to-end reinforcement learning framework (ModEL) for autonomous driving, which combines the merits of both previous approaches.

94, TITLE: Multiwave COVID-19 Prediction Via Social Awareness-Based Graph Neural Networks Using Mobility and Web Search Data
AUTHORS: J. Xue ; T. Yabe ; K. Tsubouchi ; J. Ma ; S. V. Ukkusuri
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, to predict the multiwave pandemic, we propose a Social Awareness-Based Graph Neural Network (SAB-GNN) that considers the decay of symptom-related web search frequency to capture the changes in public awareness across multiple waves.

95, TITLE: Multimodal-Boost: Multimodal Medical Image Super-Resolution Using Multi-Attention Network with Wavelet Transform
AUTHORS: FARAH DEEBA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Applying the same model for medical images from diverse modalities is challenging, our work addresses (ii) by training and performing on several modalities via transfer learning.

96, TITLE: HDRVideo-GAN: Deep Generative HDR Video Reconstruction
AUTHORS: Mrinal Anand ; Nidhin Harilal ; Chandan Kumar ; Shanmuganathan Raman
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an end-to-end GAN-based framework for HDR video reconstruction from LDR sequences with alternating exposures.

97, TITLE: MHAttnSurv: Multi-Head Attention for Survival Prediction Using Whole-Slide Pathology Images
AUTHORS: Shuai Jiang ; Arief A. Suriawinata ; Saeed Hassanpour
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we developed a multi-head attention approach to focus on various parts of a tumor slide, for more comprehensive information extraction from WSIs.

98, TITLE: Model Inspired Autoencoder for Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
AUTHORS: Jianjun Liu ; Zebin Wu ; Liang Xiao ; Xiao-Jun Wu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In the encoding stage, we present a pixel-wise fusion model to estimate hidden outputs directly, and then reformulate and unfold the model's algorithm to form the encoder network.
