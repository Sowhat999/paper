98, TITLE: Covering All The Bases: Type-based Verification of Test Input Generators
AUTHORS: Zhe Zhou ; Ashish Mishra ; Benjamin Delaware ; Suresh Jagannathan
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Typically, developers must rely on manual inspection and post-mortem analysis of test runs to determine if the generator is providing sufficient coverage; these approaches are error-prone and difficult to scale as generators become more complex. To address this important concern, we present a new refinement type-based verification procedure for validating the coverage provided by input test generators, based on a novel interpretation of types that embeds ``must-style'' underapproximate reasoning principles as a fundamental part of the type system.
