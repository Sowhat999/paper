50, TITLE: Trust Calibration As A Function of The Evolution of Uncertainty in Knowledge Generation: A Survey
AUTHORS: Joshua Boley ; Maoyuan Sun
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In addition, visual analytics systems, even more than the intelligent systems which (traditionally) tend to be closed to direct human input and direction during processing, are influenced by a multitude of cognitive biases that further exacerbate an accounting of the uncertainties that may afflict the user's confidence, and ultimately trust in the system. In this article we argue that accounting for the propagation of uncertainty from data sources all the way through extraction of information and hypothesis testing is necessary to understand how user trust in a visual analytics system evolves over its lifecycle, and that the analyst's selection of visualization parameters affords us a simple means to capture the interactions between uncertainty and cognitive bias as a function of the attributes of the search tasks the analyst executes while evaluating explanations.
