	In this paper, we try to reveal the influence of the binomial crossover
 by performing a theoretical comparison between the $(1+1)EA$ and its 
variants, the $(1+1)EA_{C}$ and the $(1+1)EA_{CM}$.

81, TITLE:	Training Feedback Spiking Neural Networks By Implicit Differentiation on The Equilibrium State
AUTHORS:	Mingqing Xiao ; Qingyan Meng ; Zongpeng Zhang ; Yisen Wang ; Zhouchen Lin
CATEGORY:	cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we consider feedback spiking neural networks, which are 
more brain-like, and propose a novel training method that does not rely 
on the exact reverse of the forward computation.

AUTHORS:	Sadegh Rabiee ; Connor Basich ; Kyle Hollins Wray ; Shlomo Zilberstein ; Joydeep Biswas
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, I.2.9; I.2.10]

 task-level competence in novel deployment environments.

85, TITLE:	Large-scale Crash Localization Using Multi-Task Learning
AUTHORS:	MANISH SHETTY et. al.

86, TITLE:	Towards A Theory of Out-of-distribution Learning
AUTHORS:	ALI GEISA et. al.
CATEGORY:	stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	20 century formalizations of learning theory -- which precipitated 
revolutions in artificial intelligence -- focus primarily on 
\textit{in-distribution} learning, that is, learning under the 
assumption that the training data are sampled from the same distribution
 as the evaluation distribution.

87, TITLE:	Can
 Phones, Syllables, and Words Emerge As Side-products of 
Cross-situational Audiovisual Learning? -- A Computational Investigation
AUTHORS:	Khazar Khorrami ; Okko Räsänen
CATEGORY:	eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SD, I.2.0; I.2.6; I.2.7; I.2.10]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this study, we formulate this idea as the so-called latent language 
hypothesis (LLH), connecting linguistic representation learning to 
general predictive processing within and across sensory modalities.

88, TITLE:	Multi-frame Joint Enhancement for Early Interlaced Videos
AUTHORS:	YANG ZHAO et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Therefore, this paper proposes a multiframe deinterlacing network joint
 enhancement network for early interlaced videos that consists of three 
modules, i.e., spatial vertical interpolation module, temporal alignment
 and fusion module, and final refinement module.

89, TITLE:	Towards Flexible Blind JPEG Artifacts Removal
AUTHORS:	Jiaxi Jiang ; Kai Zhang ; Radu Timofte
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 94A08, I.2; I.4]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Besides, we find existing methods are prone to fail on non-aligned 
double JPEG images even with only a one-pixel shift, and we thus propose
 a double JPEG degradation model to augment the training data.

90, TITLE:	From Beginner to Master: A Survey for Deep Learning-based Single-Image Super-Resolution
AUTHORS:	Juncheng Li ; Zehua Pei ; Tieyong Zeng
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this survey, we give an overview of DL-based SISR methods and group 
them according to their targets, such as reconstruction efficiency, 
reconstruction accuracy, and perceptual accuracy.

AUTHORS:	GUOTAI WANG et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	To overcome these problems, we propose a novel convolutional neural 
network called PF-Net and incorporate it into a semi-supervised learning
 framework based on Iterative Confidence-based Refinement And Weighting 
of pseudo Labels (I-CRAWL).

AUTHORS:	Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman ; Ghada Zamzmi ; Sameer Antani
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, 68T07, I.4]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We performed localization studies to interpret model behavior to ensure
 that the individual models and their ensembles precisely learned the 
regions of interest showing disease manifestations to classify the chest
 X-rays to their respective categories.

brain stem and cerebellum in Displacement Encoding with Stimulated 
Echoes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DENSE-MRI) data.
