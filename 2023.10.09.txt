CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: We show using Wiener's Tauberian theorem that the hidden representation is identifiable up to an affine transformation in Z-space, which is sufficient for intervention extrapolation. The identifiability is characterized by a novel constraint describing the linearity assumption of A on Z. Based on this insight, we propose a method that enforces the linear invariance constraint and can be combined with any type of autoencoder.

85, TITLE: Dynamic Relation-Attentive Graph Neural Networks for Fraud Detection
AUTHORS: Heehyeon Kim ; Jinhyeok Choi ; Joyce Jiyoung Whang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, I.2]

86, TITLE: Small Batch Deep Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Johan Obando-Ceron ; Marc G. Bellemare ; Pablo Samuel Castro
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although critical to the learning process, this value is typically not adjusted when proposing new algorithms. In this work we present a broad empirical study that suggests {\em reducing} the batch size can result in a number of significant performance gains; this is surprising, as the general tendency when training neural networks is towards larger batch sizes for improved performance.

87, TITLE: Comparing Auxiliary Tasks for Learning Representations for Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Moritz Lange ; Noah Krystiniak ; Raphael C. Engelhardt ; Wolfgang Konen ; Laurenz Wiskott
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While a whole range of such auxiliary tasks has been proposed in the literature, a comparison on typical continuous control benchmark environments is computationally expensive and has, to the best of our knowledge, not been performed before. This paper presents such a comparison of common auxiliary tasks, based on hundreds of agents trained with state-of-the-art off-policy RL algorithms.

88, TITLE: Understanding Prompt Engineering May Not Require Rethinking Generalization
AUTHORS: Victor Akinwande ; Yiding Jiang ; Dylan Sam ; J. Zico Kolter
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This success presents a seemingly surprising observation: these methods suffer relatively little from overfitting, i.e., when a prompt is manually engineered to achieve low error on a given training set (thus rendering the method no longer actually zero-shot), the approach still performs well on held-out test data. In this paper, we show that we can explain such performance well via recourse to classical PAC-Bayes bounds.

94, TITLE: Confronting Reward Model Overoptimization with Constrained RLHF
AUTHORS: TED MOSKOVITZ et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Compounding this difficulty, because any RM is only a proxy for human evaluation, this process is vulnerable to $\textit{overoptimization}$, wherein past a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse human ratings. In this paper, we perform, to our knowledge, the first study on overoptimization in composite RMs, showing that correlation between component RMs has a significant effect on the locations of these points.
