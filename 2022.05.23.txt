1, TITLE: Explainable Graph Theory-Based Identification of Meter-Transformer Mapping
AUTHORS: Bilal Saleem ; Yang Weng

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While Manifold Mixup based task augmentation methods are domain-agnostic, we empirically find them ineffective on non-image domains. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel domain-agnostic task augmentation method, Meta-Interpolation, which utilizes expressive neural set functions to densify the meta-training task distribution using bilevel optimization.

91, TITLE: Causal Discovery and Injection for Feed-Forward Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Fabrizio Russo ; Francesca Toni
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.HC, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Neural networks have proven to be effective at solving a wide range of problems but it is often unclear whether they learn any meaningful causal relationship: this poses a problem for the robustness of neural network models and their use for high-stakes decisions. We propose a novel method overcoming this issue by injecting knowledge in the form of (possibly partial) causal graphs into feed-forward neural networks, so that the learnt model is guaranteed to conform to the graph, hence adhering to expert knowledge.

AUTHORS: RUI YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, visual distractions -- which are common in real scenes -- from high-dimensional observations can be hurtful to the learned representations in visual RL, thus degrading the performance of generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach, namely Characteristic Reward Sequence Prediction (CRESP), to extract the task-relevant information by learning reward sequence distributions (RSDs), as the reward signals are task-relevant in RL and invariant to visual distractions.

AUTHORS: ZINIU HU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

To solve this problem, we propose Multi-Task Causal Representation Learning framework, aiming to represent multi-task knowledge via disentangled neural modules, and learn which module is causally related to each task via MTL-specific invariant regularization.

106, TITLE: Exploring The Trade-off Between Plausibility, Change Intensity and Adversarial Power in Counterfactual Explanations Using Multi-objective Optimization
AUTHORS: Javier Del Ser ; Alejandro Barredo-Arrieta ; Natalia Díaz-Rodríguez ; Francisco Herrera ; Andreas Holzinger
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we argue that automated counterfactual generation should regard several aspects of the produced adversarial instances, not only their adversarial capability. To this end, we present a novel framework for the generation of counterfactual examples which formulates its goal as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing three different objectives: 1) plausibility, i.e., the likeliness of the counterfactual of being possible as per the distribution of the input data; 2) intensity of the changes to the original input; and 3) adversarial power, namely, the variability of the model's output induced by the counterfactual.
