CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we describe the three necessary elements to establish a reliable functional trustworthiness, i.e., (1) the definition of the technical distribution of the application, (2) the risk-based minimum performance requirements, and (3) the statistically valid testing based on independent random samples.

157, TITLE: XVal: A Continuous Number Encoding for Large Language Models
AUTHORS: SIAVASH GOLKAR et. al.
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose xVal, a numerical encoding scheme that represents any real number using just a single token.

158, TITLE: Zero Resource Code-switched Speech Benchmark Using Speech Utterance Pairs For Multiple Spoken Languages
AUTHORS: Kuan-Po Huang ; Chih-Kai Yang ; Yu-Kuan Fu ; Ewan Dunbar ; Hung-yi Lee
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce a new zero resource code-switched speech benchmark designed to directly assess the code-switching capabilities of self-supervised speech encoders.

159, TITLE: Prompting and Adapter Tuning for Self-supervised Encoder-Decoder Speech Model
AUTHORS: KAI-WEI CHANG et. al.

160, TITLE: Continual Contrastive Spoken Language Understanding
AUTHORS: UMBERTO CAPPELLAZZO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning sequence-to-sequence models for spoken language understanding in a class-incremental learning (CIL) setting and we propose COCONUT, a CIL method that relies on the combination of experience replay and contrastive learning.

161, TITLE: Multi-Prompt Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Xiangru Li ; Yifei Zhang ; Liang Zhao
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we introduce a novel fine-tuning framework that leverages SAM's ability to bundle and process multiple prompts per image and seeks to improve SAM's performance in medical images.

162, TITLE: Tracking Anything in Heart All at Once
AUTHORS: CHENGKANG SHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, current techniques suffer incomplete and inaccurate motion estimation of the myocardium both in spatial and temporal dimensions, hindering the early identification of myocardial dysfunction. In addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Neural Cardiac Motion Field (NeuralCMF).

163, TITLE: Fully Automatic Segmentation of Gross Target Volume and Organs-at-Risk for Radiotherapy Planning of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
AUTHORS: Mehdi Astaraki ; Simone Bendazzoli ; Iuliana Toma-Dasu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a fully-automatic framework and develop two models for a) segmentation of 45 Organs at Risk (OARs) and b) two Gross Tumor Volumes (GTVs).

164, TITLE: Learning Interpretable Deep Disentangled Neural Networks for Hyperspectral Unmixing
AUTHORS: Ricardo Augusto Borsoi ; Deniz Erdo?mu? ; Tales Imbiriba
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a new interpretable deep learning method for hyperspectral unmixing that accounts for nonlinearity and endmember variability.

165, TITLE: All Sizes Matter: Improving Volumetric Brain Segmentation on Small Lesions
AUTHORS: AYHAN CAN ERDUR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we develop an ensemble of neural networks explicitly fo cused on detecting and segmenting small BMs.

166, TITLE: LROC-PANGU-GAN: Closing The Simulation Gap in Learning Crater Segmentation with Planetary Simulators
AUTHORS: JAEWON LA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, models trained on their outputs suffer when deployed in the face of realism they have not encountered in their training data distributions. In this paper, we therefore introduce a system to close this "realism" gap while retaining label fidelity.

167, TITLE: Multi-Resolution Fusion for Fully Automatic Cephalometric Landmark Detection
AUTHORS: Dongqian Guo ; Wencheng Han
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Based on extensive data observations and quantitative analyses, we discovered that visual features from different receptive fields affect the detection accuracy of various landmarks differently.

168, TITLE: Multi-Dimension-Embedding-Aware Modality Fusion Transformer for Psychiatric Disorder Clasification
AUTHORS: GUOXIN WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we proposed a multi-dimension-embedding-aware modality fusion transformer (MFFormer) for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder classification using rs-fMRI and T1 weighted structural MRI (T1w sMRI).

169, TITLE: OCU-Net: A Novel U-Net Architecture for Enhanced Oral Cancer Segmentation
AUTHORS: Ahmed Albishri ; Syed Jawad Hussain Shah ; Yugyung Lee ; Rong Wang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In addition, OCU-Net integrates other innovative components such as Squeeze-and-Excite (SE) attention module, Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module, residual blocks, and multi-scale fusion. The incorporation of these modules showed superior performance for oral cancer segmentation for two datasets used in this research.
