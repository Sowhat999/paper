AUTHORS: ZEKUN LI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address these challenges, we propose a novel three-component method, i.e., 1) a deep multiple instance learning component with instance-level attention to jointly classify the bag and also weigh the instances, 2) a bag-level data augmentation component to generate virtual bags by reorganizing high confidential instances, and 3) a self-supervised pretext component to aid the learning process.
