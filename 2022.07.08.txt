AUTHORS: JIANGCHAO YAO et. al.

To overcome this issue, we propose a meta controller to dynamically manage the collaboration between the on-device recommender and the cloud-based recommender, and introduce a novel efficient sample construction from the causal perspective to solve the dataset absence issue of meta controller.

AUTHORS: YUZHI ZHAO et. al.

AUTHORS: Bradley C. A. Brown ; Anthony L. Caterini ; Brendan Leigh Ross ; Jesse C. Cresswell ; Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem
