91, TITLE: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) Powered Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Mini Review, Comparison and Perspectives
AUTHORS: Guang Yang ; Jun Lv ; Yutong Chen ; Jiahao Huang ; Jin Zhu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 68T01]
HIGHLIGHT: In this chapter, we review the GAN powered fast MRI methods with a comparative study on various anatomical datasets to demonstrate the generalisability and robustness of this kind of fast MRI while providing future perspectives.

92, TITLE: Attention-based Stylisation for Exemplar Image Colourisation
AUTHORS: Marc Gorriz Blanch ; Issa Khalifeh ; Alan Smeaton ; Noel O'Connor ; Marta Mrak

HIGHLIGHT: Attention-based Stylisation for Exemplar Image Colourisation

93, TITLE: COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-ray Images Using Imprinted Weights Approach
AUTHORS: JIANXING ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this challenge, we propose the use of a low-shot learning approach named imprinted weights, taking advantage of the abundance of samples from known illnesses such as pneumonia to improve the detection performance on COVID-19.

94, TITLE: CUAB: Convolutional Uncertainty Attention Block Enhanced The Chest X-ray Image Analysis
AUTHORS: Chi-Shiang Wang ; Fang-Yi Su ; Tsung-Lu Michael Lee ; Yi-Shan Tsai ; Jung-Hsien Chiang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We evaluated the CUAB with notable backbone models, ResNet and ResNeXt, on a medical image segmentation task.

95, TITLE: Joint Registration and Segmentation Via Multi-Task Learning for Adaptive Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer
AUTHORS: MOHAMED S. ELMAHDY et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we formulate registration and segmentation as a joint problem via a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) setting, allowing these tasks to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses through the sharing of beneficial information.

96, TITLE: Rethinking Ultrasound Augmentation: A Physics-Inspired Approach
AUTHORS: MARIA TIRINDELLI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose a set of physics-inspired transformations, including deformation, reverb and Signal-to-Noise Ratio, that we apply on US B-mode images for data augmentation.

97, TITLE: Lesion Segmentation and RECIST Diameter Prediction Via Click-driven Attention and Dual-path Connection
AUTHORS: YOUBAO TANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a prior-guided dual-path network (PDNet) to segment common types of lesions throughout the whole body and predict their RECIST diameters accurately and automatically.
