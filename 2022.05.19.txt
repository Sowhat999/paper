HIGHLIGHT: When such functions are approximated by neural networks this introduces a compelling alternative to the more common multi-dimensional array representation. Recent work on such Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) has shown that - following careful architecture search - INRs can outperform established compression methods such as JPEG (e.g. Dupont et al., 2021).

86, TITLE: Speckle Image Restoration Without Clean Data
AUTHORS: Tsung-Ming Tai ; Yun-Jie Jhang ; Wen-Jyi Hwang ; Chau-Jern Cheng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel image restoration algorithm that can perform speckle noise removal without clean data and does not require multiple noisy observations in the same view angle.

87, TITLE: Deep-learned Orthogonal Basis Patterns for Fast, Noise-robust Single-pixel Imaging
AUTHORS: Ritz Ann Aguilar ; Damian Dailisan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.ins-det]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a modified deep convolutional autoencoder network (DCAN) for SPI on 64x64 pixel images with up to 6.25% compression ratio and apply binary and orthogonality regularizers during training.

88, TITLE: 3D Segmentation Guided Style-based Generative Adversarial Networks for PET Synthesis
AUTHORS: YANG ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here we propose a novel segmentation guided style-based generative adversarial network (SGSGAN) for PET synthesis.

89, TITLE: COVID-Net UV: An End-to-End Spatio-Temporal Deep Neural Network Architecture for Automated Diagnosis of COVID-19 Infection from Ultrasound Videos
AUTHORS: Hilda Azimi ; Ashkan Ebadi ; Jessy Song ; Pengcheng Xi ; Alexander Wong
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose COVID-Net UV, an end-to-end hybrid spatio-temporal deep neural network architecture, to detect COVID-19 infection from lung point-of-care ultrasound videos captured by convex transducers.

90, TITLE: Deep Reinforcement Learning Based on Location-Aware Imitation Environment for RIS-Aided MmWave MIMO Systems
AUTHORS: Wangyang Xu ; Jiancheng An ; Chongwen Huang ; Lu Gan ; Chau Yuen
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This letter offers a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on a location-aware imitation environment for the joint beamforming design in an RIS-aided mmWave multiple-input multiple-output system.
