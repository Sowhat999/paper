92, TITLE: Tight Runtime Bounds for Static Unary Unbiased Evolutionary Algorithms on Linear Functions
AUTHORS: Carola Doerr ; Duri Andrea Janett ; Johannes Lengler
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In a seminal paper in 2013, Witt showed that the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm with standard bit mutation needs time $(1+o(1))n \ln n/p_1$ to find the optimum of any linear function, as long as the probability $p_1$ to flip exactly one bit is $\Theta(1)$. In this paper we investigate how this result generalizes if standard bit mutation is replaced by an arbitrary unbiased mutation operator.

HIGHLIGHT: However, MOME is limited by non-directed genetic search mechanisms which struggle in high-dimensional search spaces. In this work, we present Multi-Objective MAP-Elites with Policy-Gradient Assistance and Crowding-based Exploration (MOME-PGX): a new QD algorithm that extends MOME to improve its data efficiency and performance.

94, TITLE: Lasting Diversity and Superior Runtime Guarantees for The $(?+1)$ Genetic Algorithm
AUTHORS: Benjamin Doerr ; Aymen Echarghaoui ; Mohammed Jamal ; Martin S. Krejca
