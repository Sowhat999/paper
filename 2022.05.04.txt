87, TITLE: On The Effect of Information Asymmetry in Human-AI Teams
AUTHORS: Patrick Hemmer ; Max Schemmer ; Niklas K√ºhl ; Michael V√∂ssing ; Gerhard Satzger
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, CTP is rarely demonstrated in previous work as often the focus is on the design of explainability, while a fundamental prerequisite -- the presence of complementarity potential between humans and AI -- is often neglected. Therefore, we focus on the existence of this potential for effective human-AI decision-making.

88, TITLE: How Does Embodiment Affect The Human Perception of Computational Creativity? An Experimental Study Framework
AUTHORS: Simo Linkola ; Christian Guckelsberger ; Tomi M√§nnist√∂ ; Anna Kantosalo
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: Recently, the system's embodiment has been put forward as such a factor, but empirical studies of its effect are lacking. To this end, we propose an experimental framework which isolates the effect of embodiment on the perception of creativity from its effect on creativity per se.

89, TITLE: A Comparison of Approaches for Imbalanced Classification Problems in The Context of Retrieving Relevant Documents for An Analysis
AUTHORS: Sandra Wankm√ºller
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.CL, stat.AP, stat.ML, I.2.7; H.3.3]
HIGHLIGHT: One of the first steps in many text-based social science studies is to retrieve documents that are relevant for the analysis from large corpora of otherwise irrelevant documents. The conventional approach in social science to address this retrieval task is to apply a set of keywords and to consider those documents to be relevant that contain at least one of the keywords.

93, TITLE: Triangular Dropout: Variable Network Width Without Retraining
AUTHORS: Edward W. Staley ; Jared Markowitz

AUTHORS: DANILO VUCETIC et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL]

We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first decidability result for the problem of determining whether such a program generates exactly a specified distribution over its outputs (provided the program terminates almost surely).
