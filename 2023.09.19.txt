318, TITLE: HiFTNet: A Fast High-Quality Neural Vocoder with Harmonic-plus-Noise Filter and Inverse Short Time Fourier Transform
AUTHORS: Yinghao Aaron Li ; Cong Han ; Xilin Jiang ; Nima Mesgarani
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce an extension to iSTFTNet, termed HiFTNet, which incorporates a harmonic-plus-noise source filter in the time-frequency domain that uses a sinusoidal source from the fundamental frequency (F0) inferred via a pre-trained F0 estimation network for fast inference speed.

319, TITLE: VSHARP: Variable Splitting Half-quadratic ADMM Algorithm for Reconstruction of Inverse-Problems
AUTHORS: George Yiasemis ; Nikita Moriakov ; Jan-Jakob Sonke ; Jonas Teuwen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose vSHARP (variable Splitting Half-quadratic ADMM algorithm for Reconstruction of inverse Problems), a novel DL-based method for solving ill-posed inverse problems arising in MI.

320, TITLE: Joint Demosaicing and Denoising with Double Deep Image Priors
AUTHORS: Taihui Li ; Anish Lahiri ; Yutong Dai ; Owen Mayer
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel joint demosaicing and denoising method, dubbed JDD-DoubleDIP, which operates directly on a single RAW image without requiring any training data.

321, TITLE: Self-supervised TransUNet for Ultrasound Regional Segmentation of The Distal Radius in Children
AUTHORS: YUYUE ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recently, to quench the thirst for large data sets with high-quality annotation, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods using unlabeled domain-specific data, have attracted attention. Therefore, designing an SSL method that relies on minimal quantities of labeled data has far-reaching significance in medical images.

322, TITLE: An Accurate and Efficient Neural Network for OCTA Vessel Segmentation and A New Dataset
AUTHORS: Haojian Ning ; Chengliang Wang ; Xinrun Chen ; Shiying Li
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose an accurate and efficient neural network for retinal vessel segmentation in OCTA images.

323, TITLE: BRONCO: Automated Modelling of The Bronchovascular Bundle Using The Computed Tomography Images
AUTHORS: WOJCIECH PRA?UCH et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a segmentation pipeline for the bronchovascular bundle based on the Computed Tomography images, returning either binary or labelled masks of vessels and bronchi situated in the lung parenchyma.

324, TITLE: Deep Conditional Generative Models for Longitudinal Single-slice Abdominal Computed Tomography Harmonization
AUTHORS: XIN YU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, longitudinal analysis of body composition changes using these scans is difficult due to positional variation between slices acquired in different years, which leading to different organs/tissues captured. To address this issue, we propose C-SliceGen, which takes an arbitrary axial slice in the abdominal region as a condition and generates a pre-defined vertebral level slice by estimating structural changes in the latent space.

325, TITLE: Emerging Approaches for THz Array Imaging: A Tutorial Review and Software Tool
AUTHORS: Josiah W. Smith ; Murat Torlak
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This article provides a tutorial review of systems and algorithms for THz SAR in the near-field with an emphasis on emerging algorithms that combine signal processing and machine learning techniques.
