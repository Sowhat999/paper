In this paper, we propose a novel table-to-text approach and tackle these problems with a novel two-step architecture which is enhanced by auto-correction, copy mechanism and synthetic data augmentation.

33, TITLE: Leveraging Locality in Abstractive Text Summarization
AUTHORS: YIXIN LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the successes of neural attention models for natural language generation tasks, the quadratic memory complexity of the self-attention module with respect to the input length hinders their applications in long text summarization. Instead of designing more efficient attention modules, we approach this problem by investigating if models with a restricted context can have competitive performance compared with the memory-efficient attention models that maintain a global context by treating the input as an entire sequence.

34, TITLE: Garden-Path Traversal Within GPT-2
AUTHORS: William Jurayj ; William Rudman ; Carsten Eickhoff
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

We present a collection of methods for analyzing GPT-2's hidden states, and use the model's navigation of garden path sentences as a case study to demonstrate the utility of studying this model's behavior beyond its output alone.

AUTHORS: Silviu Paun ; Juntao Yu ; Nafise Sadat Moosavi ; Massimo Poesio
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Although this type of anaphoric reference is now annotated in many datasets, systems interpreting such references cannot be evaluated using the Reference coreference scorer Pradhan et al. (2014). As part of the work towards a new scorer for anaphoric reference able to evaluate all aspects of anaphoric interpretation in the coverage of the Universal Anaphora initiative, we propose in this paper a solution to the technical problem of generalizing existing metrics for identity anaphora so that they can also be used to score cases of split-antecedents.

HIGHLIGHT: In order for NLP technology to be widely applicable and useful, it needs to be inclusive of users across the world's languages, equitable, i.e., not unduly biased towards any particular language, and accessible to users, particularly in low-resource settings where compute constraints are common. In this paper, we propose an evaluation paradigm that assesses NLP technologies across all three dimensions, hence quantifying the diversity of users they can serve.

61, TITLE: ZeroGen$^+$: Self-Guided High-Quality Data Generation in Efficient Zero-Shot Learning
AUTHORS: JIAHUI GAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite its remarkable results, we observe that the synthesized data from PLM contains a significant portion of samples with low quality, overfitting on such data greatly hampers the performance of the trained model and makes it unreliable for deployment.Since no gold data is accessible in zero-shot scenario, it is hard to perform model/data selection to prevent overfitting to the low-quality data. To address this problem, we propose a noise-robust bi-level re-weighting framework which is able to learn the per-sample weights measuring the data quality without requiring any gold data.

In contrast to existing approaches, this does not require any explanations for training a separate verification model.

152, TITLE: UniInst: Unique Representation for End-to-End Instance Segmentation
AUTHORS: YIMIN OU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.GR]
HIGHLIGHT: While the LED panels used in virtual production systems can display vibrant imagery with a wide color gamut, they produce problematic color shifts when used as lighting due to their peaky spectral output from narrow-band red, green, and blue LEDs. In this work, we present an improved color calibration process for virtual production stages which ameliorates this color rendition problem while also passing through accurate in-camera background colors.
