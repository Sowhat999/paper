AUTHORS: SHIWALI MOHAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, I.2.4; I.2.6]
HIGHLIGHT: Model-based reasoning agents are ill-equipped to act in novel situations in which their model of the environment no longer sufficiently represents the world. We propose HYDRA - a framework for designing model-based agents operating in mixed discrete-continuous worlds, that can autonomously detect when the environment has evolved from its canonical setup, understand how it has evolved, and adapt the agents' models to perform effectively.

CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.RO, I.2.6; I.2.7]

We describe a cognitive-agent approach that extends and complements prompt engineering, mitigating its limitations, and thus enabling a robot to acquire new task knowledge matched to its native language capabilities, embodiment, environment, and user preferences.

To overcome these challenges, we propose GKD, a general knowledge distillation framework that supports distillation on larger-scale PLMs using various distillation methods.

22, TITLE: Record Deduplication for Entity Distribution Modeling in ASR Transcripts
AUTHORS: Tianyu Huang ; Chung Hoon Hong ; Carl Wivagg ; Kanna Shimizu
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: There are several challenges with this approach: (1) the entity set must be frequently reconstructed, (2) the entity set is of limited size due to latency and accuracy trade-offs, and (3) finding the true entity distribution for biasing is complicated by ASR misrecognition. We address these challenges and define an entity set by modeling customers true requested entity distribution from ASR output in production using record deduplication, a technique from the field of entity resolution.

AUTHORS: XIZE CHENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, when training the specific model of new domain, it often gets stuck in the lack of new-domain utterances, especially the labeled visual utterances. To break through this restriction, we attempt to achieve zero-shot modality transfer by maintaining the multi-modality alignment in phoneme space learned with unlabeled multimedia utterances in the high resource domain during the pre-training \cite{shi2022learning}, and propose a training system Open-modality Speech Recognition (\textbf{OpenSR}) that enables the models trained on a single modality (e.g., audio-only) applicable to more modalities (e.g., visual-only and audio-visual).

We find that robust representations of both phonetic and phonemic distinctions emerge in early layers of these models' architectures, and are preserved in the principal components of deeper layer representations.

To tackle this issue and learn more expressive prior models, we propose an energy-based model (EBM) on the joint latent space over all layers of latent variables with the multi-layer generator as its backbone.

181, TITLE: Efficiently Learning The Graph for Semi-supervised Learning
AUTHORS: Dravyansh Sharma ; Maxwell Jones
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Known techniques to improve efficiency typically involve an approximation of the graph regularization objective, but suffer two major drawbacks - first the graph is assumed to be known or constructed with heuristic hyperparameter values, second they do not provide a principled approximation guarantee for learning over the full unlabeled dataset. Building on recent work on learning graphs for semi-supervised learning from multiple datasets for problems from the same domain, and leveraging techniques for fast approximations for solving linear systems in the graph Laplacian matrix, we propose algorithms that overcome both the above limitations.

HIGHLIGHT: While numerous works have focused on devising efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) with uniformly bounded rewards, it remains an open question whether sample or time-efficient algorithms for RL with large state-action space exist when the rewards are \emph{heavy-tailed}, i.e., with only finite $(1+\epsilon)$-th moments for some $\epsilon\in(0,1]$. In this work, we address the challenge of such rewards in RL with linear function approximation.

239, TITLE: On Robot Grasp Learning Using Equivariant Models
AUTHORS: XUPENG ZHU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this is generally difficult due to the large amount of training data required by most grasp learning models. In this paper, we note that the planar grasp function is $\SE(2)$-equivariant and demonstrate that this structure can be used to constrain the neural network used during learning.

AUTHORS: ZIYUAN ZHONG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]

241, TITLE: On The Efficacy of 3D Point Cloud Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Zhan Ling ; Yunchao Yao ; Xuanlin Li ; Hao Su

242, TITLE: Reinforcement Learning in Robotic Motion Planning By Combined Experience-based Planning and Self-Imitation Learning
AUTHORS: Sha Luo ; Lambert Schomaker
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: For real robots, it is challenging to collect enough qualified data either as demonstrations for IL or experiences for RL due to safety considerations in environments with obstacles. We target this challenge by proposing the self-imitation learning by planning plus (SILP+) algorithm, which efficiently embeds experience-based planning into the learning architecture to mitigate the data-collection problem.

In this paper, we propose ARIST, a novel automated argument recommendation approach which suggests arguments by predicting developers' expectations when they define and use API methods.

HIGHLIGHT: Many stochastic continuous-state dynamical systems can be modeled as probabilistic programs with nonlinear non-polynomial updates in non-nested loops. We present two methods, one approximate and one exact, to automatically compute, without sampling, moment-based invariants for such probabilistic programs as closed-form solutions parameterized by the loop iteration.

AUTHORS: JANEK GR√ñHL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.LG, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins.

259, TITLE: TransMRSR: Transformer-based Self-Distilled Generative Prior for Brain MRI Super-Resolution
AUTHORS: SHAN HUANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The common Single image super-resolution (SISR) solutions face two main challenges: (1) local detailed and global anatomical structural information combination; and (2) large-scale restoration when applied for reconstructing thick-slice MRI into high-resolution (HR) iso-tropic data. To address these problems, we propose a novel two-stage network for brain MRI SR named TransMRSR based on the convolutional blocks to extract local information and transformer blocks to capture long-range dependencies.
