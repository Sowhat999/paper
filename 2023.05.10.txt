CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: There is little understanding about the impact of introducing foundation models in software architecture. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a taxonomy of foundation model based systems, which classifies and compares the characteristics of foundation models and foundation model based systems.

165, TITLE: AudioSlots: A Slot-centric Generative Model for Audio Separation
AUTHORS: Pradyumna Reddy ; Scott Wisdom ; Klaus Greff ; John R. Hershey ; Thomas Kipf
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In a range of recent works, object-centric architectures have been shown to be suitable for unsupervised scene decomposition in the vision domain. Inspired by these methods we present AudioSlots, a slot-centric generative model for blind source separation in the audio domain.

166, TITLE: Cooperating Graph Neural Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Vaccine Prioritization
AUTHORS: Lu Ling ; Washim Uddin Mondal ; Satish V
CATEGORY: q-bio.PE [q-bio.PE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This study explores the vaccine prioritization strategy to reduce the overall burden of the pandemic when the supply is limited.

167, TITLE: Adaptive Domain Generalization for Digital Pathology Images
AUTHORS: Andrew Walker
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Thus, there is a need for "reactive" domain generalization techniques: ones that adapt to domain shifts at test-time rather than requiring predictions of or examples of the shifts at training time. We conduct a literature review and introduce techniques that react to domain shifts rather than requiring a prediction of them in advance.

168, TITLE: Trustworthy Multi-phase Liver Tumor Segmentation Via Evidence-based Uncertainty
AUTHORS: CHUANFEI HU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel trustworthy multi-phase liver tumor segmentation (TMPLiTS), which is a unified framework jointly conducting segmentation and uncertainty estimation.

169, TITLE: Towards Unraveling Calibration Biases in Medical Image Analysis
AUTHORS: María Agustina Ricci Lara ; Candelaria Mosquera ; Enzo Ferrante ; Rodrigo Echeveste
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we study discrimination and calibration biases in models trained for automatic detection of malignant dermatological conditions from skin lesions images.

170, TITLE: Multiscale Augmented Normalizing Flows for Image Compression
AUTHORS: Marc Windsheimer ; Fabian Brand ; André Kaup
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a novel concept, which adapts the hierarchical latent space for augmented normalizing flows, an invertible latent variable model.

171, TITLE: Bone Marrow Cytomorphology Cell Detection Using InceptionResNetV2
AUTHORS: Raisa Fairooz Meem ; Khandaker Tabin Hasan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a novel transfer learning model for Bone Marrow Cell Detection to provide a solution to all the difficulties faced for the task along with considerable accuracy.

172, TITLE: Synthesis of Annotated Colorectal Cancer Tissue Images from Gland Layout
AUTHORS: Srijay Deshpande ; Fayyaz Minhas ; Nasir Rajpoot
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Such synthetic images and their annotations can be useful in training and evaluation of algorithms in the domain of computational pathology. To address this, we present an interactive framework to generate pairs of realistic colorectal cancer histology images with corresponding tissue component masks from the input gland layout.

173, TITLE: Domain Agnostic Image-to-image Translation Using Low-Resolution Conditioning
AUTHORS: Mohamed Abid ; Arman Afrasiyabi ; Ihsen Hedhli ; Jean-François Lalonde ; Christian Gagné
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To do so, we present a novel approach that relies on training the generative model to produce images that both share distinctive information of the associated source image and correctly match the LR target image when downscaled.

174, TITLE: Echo from Noise: Synthetic Ultrasound Image Generation Using Diffusion Models for Real Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: David Stojanovski ; Uxio Hermida ; Pablo Lamata ; Arian Beqiri ; Alberto Gomez
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic images via Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) guided by cardiac ultrasound semantic label maps.

175, TITLE: TinyML Design Contest for Life-Threatening Ventricular Arrhythmia Detection
AUTHORS: ZHENGE JIA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The challenge problem of TDC'22 is to develop a novel AI/ML-based real-time detection algorithm for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia over low-power microcontrollers utilized in Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICDs).
