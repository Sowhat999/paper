106, TITLE: Two-Stream Graph Convolutional Network for Intra-oral Scanner Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: YUE ZHAO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, since different raw attributes reveal completely different geometric information, the naive concatenation of different raw attributes at the (low-level) input stage may bring unnecessary confusion in describing and differentiating between mesh cells, thus hampering the learning of high-level geometric representations for the segmentation task. To address this issue, we design a two-stream graph convolutional network (i.e., TSGCN), which can effectively handle inter-view confusion between different raw attributes to more effectively fuse their complementary information and learn discriminative multi-view geometric representations.
