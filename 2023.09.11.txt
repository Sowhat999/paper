83, TITLE: Towards Mitigating Architecture Overfitting in Dataset Distillation
AUTHORS: Xuyang Zhong ; Chen Liu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, a significant challenge arises in the form of architecture overfitting: the distilled training data synthesized by a specific network architecture (i.e., training network) generates poor performance when trained by other network architectures (i.e., test networks). This paper addresses this issue and proposes a series of approaches in both architecture designs and training schemes which can be adopted together to boost the generalization performance across different network architectures on the distilled training data.

85, TITLE: On The Actionability of Outcome Prediction
AUTHORS: Lydia T. Liu ; Solon Barocas ; Jon Kleinberg ; Karen Levy

86, TITLE: REALM: Robust Entropy Adaptive Loss Minimization for Improved Single-Sample Test-Time Adaptation
AUTHORS: Skyler Seto ; Barry-John Theobald ; Federico Danieli ; Navdeep Jaitly ; Dan Busbridge
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]

In this work, we present a general framework for improving robustness of F-TTA to these noisy samples, inspired by self-paced learning and robust loss functions.

88, TITLE: Subwords As Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: David Yunis ; Justin Jung ; Falcon Dai ; Matthew Walter
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: Typically such methods require a lengthy pretraining phase, especially in continuous action spaces, in order to form the skills before reinforcement learning can begin. Given prior evidence that the full range of the continuous action space is not required in such tasks, we propose a novel approach to skill-generation with two components.

93, TITLE: Historia: Refuting Callback Reachability with Message-History Logics (Extended Version)
AUTHORS: Shawn Meier ; Sergio Mover ; Gowtham Kaki ; Bor-Yuh Evan Chang
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, 68Q60, D.3.3]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper determines if a callback can be called by an event-driven framework in an unexpected state.Event-driven programming frameworks are pervasive for creating user-interactive apps on just about every modern platform.Control flow between callbacks is determined by the framework and largely opaque to the programmer.This opacity of the callback control flow not only causes difficulty for the programmer but is also difficult for those developing static analysis.Previous static analysis techniques address this opacity either by assuming an arbitrary framework implementation or attempting to eagerly specify all possible callback control flow, but this is either too coarse or too burdensome and tricky to get right.Instead, we present a middle way where the callback control flow can be gradually refined in a targeted manner to prove assertions of interest.The key insight to get this middle way is by reasoning about the history of method invocations at the boundary between app and framework code - enabling a decoupling of the specification of callback control flow from the analysis of app code.We call the sequence of such boundary-method invocations message histories and develop message-history logics to do this reasoning.In particular, we define the notion of an application-only transition system with boundary transitions, a message-history program logic for programs with such transitions, and a temporal specification logic for capturing callback control flow in a targeted and compositional manner.Then to utilize the logics in a goal-directed verifier, we define a way to combine after-the-fact an assertion about message histories with a specification of callback control flow.We implemented a prototype message history-based verifier called Historia that enables proving the absence of multi-callback bug patterns in real-world open-source Android apps.
