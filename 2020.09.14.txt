AUTHORS:        Shahryar Rahnamayan ; Seyed Jalaleddin Mousavirad
COMMENTS:       Accepted in IEEE International Conference On Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 2020, Toronto, Canada
CATEGORY:       cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a modified Coordinate Descent algorithm (MCD) to tackle LSEGO problems with a limited computational budget.

46, TITLE:      Integration of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire-Neurons in Deep Learning Architectures
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13532
AUTHORS:        Richard C. Gerum ; Achim Schilling
CATEGORY:       cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.LG, q-bio.NC]
HIGHLIGHT:      We apply a novel approach to train the LIF units supervisedly via backpropagation, by assigning a constant value to the derivative of the neuron activation function exclusively for the backpropagation step.

47, TITLE:      CheckDP: An Automated and Integrated Approach for Proving Differential Privacy or Finding Precise Counterexamples
http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07485
AUTHORS:        Yuxin Wang ; Zeyu Ding ; Daniel Kifer ; Danfeng Zhang
CATEGORY:       cs.PL [cs.PL, D.3.1]
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose CheckDP, the first automated and integrated approach for proving or disproving claims that a mechanism is differentially private.

48, TITLE:      Smooth Contextual Bandits: Bridging the Parametric and Non-differentiable Regret Regimes
http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02553
AUTHORS:        Yichun Hu ; Nathan Kallus ; Xiaojie Mao
CATEGORY:       stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.OC, math.ST, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT:      We study a nonparametric contextual bandit problem where the expected reward functions belong to a H\"older class with smoothness parameter $\beta$.

49, TITLE:      Incremental Learning for End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04288
AUTHORS:        Li Fu ; Xiaoxiao Li ; Libo Zi
COMMENTS:       5 pages, 3 figures
CATEGORY:       eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a new incremental learning for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to extend the model's capacity on a new task while retaining the performance on previous ones.

50, TITLE:      Joint Generative Learning and Super-Resolution For Real-World Camera-Screen Degradation
http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00195
AUTHORS:        Guanghao Yin ; Shouqian Sun ; Chao Li ; Xin Min
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we focus on the camera-screen degradation and build a real-world dataset (Cam-ScreenSR), where HR images are original ground truths from the previous DIV2K dataset and corresponding LR images are camera-captured versions of HRs displayed on the screen.

51, TITLE:      Automated Detection of Cribriform Growth Patterns in Prostate Histology Images
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10543
AUTHORS:        Pierre Ambrosini ; Eva Hollemans ; Charlotte F. Kweldam ; Geert J. L. H. van Leenders ; Sjoerd Stallinga ; Frans Vos
COMMENTS:       15 pages, 6 figures
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      We aimed to introduce a deep learning method to detect such patterns automatically.

52, TITLE:      HHHFL: Hierarchical Heterogeneous Horizontal Federated Learning for Electroencephalography
http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05784
AUTHORS:        Dashan Gao ; Ce Ju ; Xiguang Wei ; Yang Liu ; Tianjian Chen ; Qiang Yang
COMMENTS:       5 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for International Workshop on Federated Machine Learning for User Privacy and Data Confidentiality in Conjunction with IJCAI 2019 (FL-IJCAI'2019)
CATEGORY:       eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, I.2.6; I.2.11]
HIGHLIGHT:      To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning approach to train machine learning models over heterogeneous EEG data, while preserving the data privacy of each party.
