In this thesis, we focus on relaxing these assumptions, and describe contributions toward the ultimate goal of turning cameras into truly generic depth sensors.

AUTHORS: Santhosh Karnik ; Rongrong Wang ; Mark Iwen

To reduce this gap between theory and practice, a general method for bounding the complexity required for a neural network to approximate a Lipschitz function on a high-dimensional set with a low-complexity structure is provided herein.
