In this paper we investigate this embedding and we distill "the awkward squad for reactive programming" as 3 concerns that are essential for real-world software development, but that do not fit within reactive programming.

Therefore, in this work, we propose a Multimodal Variational Adversarial Active Learning (M-VAAL) method that uses auxiliary information from additional modalities to enhance the active sampling.
