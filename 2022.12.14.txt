Therefore, this paper aims to propose three distinct contributions. First, to include the user's opinion in the compression process, the file size of the output image can be controlled by a user in advance.

To address this, we present an MRI-based deep learning method for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer applicable to a patient population with subsequent ground truth biopsy results ranging from benign pathology to ISUP grade group~5.
