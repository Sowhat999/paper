HIGHLIGHT:
	To overcome the label bias problem, we propose the adaptive label 
smoothing (ALS) method to replace the one-hot hard labels with smoothed 
ones, which learns to allocate label confidences from the biased classes
 to the others.

 corresponding unidirectional code plus a few input/output examples.

86, TITLE:	Network
 Psychometrics and Cognitive Network Science Open New Ways for 
Detecting, Understanding and Tackling The Complexity of Math Anxiety: A 
Review
AUTHORS:	Massimo Stella
CATEGORY:	cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL, math.HO, physics.soc-ph]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This review of data-informed studies outlines math anxiety as a complex
 system that: (i) cripples well-being, self-confidence and information 
processing on both conscious and subconscious levels, (ii) can be 
transmitted by social interactions, like a pathogen, and worsened by 
distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of students in 63 out 
of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly with academic 
performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students' well-being, 
computational literacy and career prospects in science.

87, TITLE:	The Emojification of Sentiment on Social Media: Collection and Analysis of A Longitudinal Twitter Sentiment Dataset
AUTHORS:	Wenjie Yin ; Rabab Alkhalifa ; Arkaitz Zubiaga
CATEGORY:	cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL, cs.DL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	There is however a gap in the longitudinal study of how sentiment 
evolved in social media over the years. We publicly release the dataset 
for further research in tasks including sentiment analysis and text 
classification of tweets.

88, TITLE:	Towards A Common Testing Terminology for Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence Experts
AUTHORS:	Lisa Jöckel ; Thomas Bauer ; Michael Kläs ; Marc P. Hauer ; Janek Groß
CATEGORY:	cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG]

	Here we propose a mathematical model of spiking neuron network (SNN) 
demonstrating how a piece of information can be maintained as a robust 
activity pattern for several seconds then completely disappear if no 
other stimuli come.
