AUTHORS: Liyan Xu ; Jinho D. Choi
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper suggests a direction of coreference resolution for online decoding on actively generated input such as dialogue, where the model accepts an utterance and its past context, then finds mentions in the current utterance as well as their referents, upon each dialogue turn. A baseline and four incremental-updated models adapted from the mention-linking paradigm are proposed for this new setting, which address different aspects including the singletons, speaker-grounded encoding and cross-turn mention contextualization.

To circumvent these shortcomings of the CE loss, in this paper, we propose a novel loss function, CORAL, that directly optimizes recently proposed estimates of human preference for generated responses.
