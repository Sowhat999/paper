AUTHORS:        Joan Thibault ; Khalil Ghorbal
HIGHLIGHT:      Several BDD variants were designed to exploit special features of Boolean functions to achieve better compression rates.Deciding a priori which variant to use is as hard as constructing the diagrams themselves and the conversion between variants comes in general with a prohibitive cost.This observation leads naturally to a growing interest into when and how one can combine existing variants to benefit from their respective sweet spots.In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, termed $\lambda$ Decision Diagram ($\lambda$DD), that revisits BDD from a purely functional point of view.
