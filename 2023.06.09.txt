33, TITLE: RRWKV: Capturing Long-range Dependencies in RWKV
AUTHORS: Leilei Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product attention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the time-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of its limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full information obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer. Therefore, the paper devises the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture via incorporating the retrospecting ability into the RWKV to effectively absorb information, which maintains memory and computational efficiency as well.

AUTHORS: XINGCHEN WAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Traditional graph search algorithms can be applied in this case, but they may be sample-inefficient and do not make use of information about the function values; on the other hand, Bayesian optimisation is a class of promising black-box solvers with superior sample efficiency, but it has been scarcely been applied to such novel setups. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Bayesian optimisation framework that optimises over functions defined on generic, large-scale and potentially unknown graphs.
