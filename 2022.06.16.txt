HIGHLIGHT: However, depth estimation based on cameras has limited accuracy, which may cause otherwise reasonable predictions that suffer from such longitudinal localization errors to be treated as false positives and false negatives. We therefore propose variants of the popular 3D AP metric that are designed to be more permissive with respect to depth estimation errors.

We present FIBER (Fusion-In-the-Backbone-based transformER), a new VL model architecture that can seamlessly handle both these types of tasks.

97, TITLE: Physically-admissible Polarimetric Data Augmentation for Road-scene Analysis
