86, TITLE: Hardware Accelerator and Neural Network Co-Optimization for Ultra-Low-Power Audio Processing Devices
AUTHORS: CHRISTOPH GERUM et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.NE, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents HANNAH (Hardware Accelerator and Neural Network seArcH), a framework for automated and combined hardware/software co-design of deep neural networks and hardware accelerators for resource and power-constrained edge devices.

87, TITLE: A Multi View Multi Stage and Multi Window Framework for Pulmonary Artery Segmentation from CT Scans
AUTHORS: ZEYU LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We solve the segmentation problem of the pulmonary artery by using a two-stage method based on a 3D CNN network.

88, TITLE: Deep Learning-Based Automatic Diagnosis System for Developmental Dysplasia of The Hip
AUTHORS: Yang Li ; Leo Yan Li-Han ; Hua Tian
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose a deep learning-based system that automatically detects 14 keypoints from a radiograph, measures three anatomical angles (center-edge, T\"onnis, and Sharp angles), and classifies DDH hips as grades I-IV based on the Crowe criteria.

89, TITLE: Learning-based and Unrolled Motion-compensated Reconstruction for Cardiac MR CINE Imaging
AUTHORS: Jiazhen Pan ; Daniel Rueckert ; Thomas K√ºstner ; Kerstin Hammernik
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a learning-based self-supervised framework for MCMR, to efficiently deal with non-rigid motion corruption in cardiac MR imaging.

90, TITLE: T$^2$LR-Net: An Unrolling Reconstruction Network Learning Transformed Tensor Low-Rank Prior for Dynamic MR Imaging
AUTHORS: Yinghao Zhang ; Yue Hu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, I.4.5; I.2.6; I.4.1]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we concentrate on the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and only provides the definite and limited tensor low-rank prior in the FFT domain, heavily reliant upon how closely the data and the FFT domain match up.
