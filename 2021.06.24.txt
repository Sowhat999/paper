HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we extend those works to DVAE-based single-channel unsupervised speech enhancement, hence exploiting both speech signals unsupervised representation learning and dynamics modeling.

88, TITLE: Bounds on Causal Effects and Application to High Dimensional Data
AUTHORS: Ang Li ; Judea Pearl
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Using this optimization method, we propose a framework for dimensionality reduction that allows one to trade bias for estimation power, and demonstrate its performance using simulation studies.

89, TITLE: Multi-modal and Frequency-weighted Tensor Nuclear Norm for Hyperspectral Image Denoising
AUTHORS: Sheng Liu ; Xiaozhen Xie ; Wenfeng Kong ; Jifeng Ning
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose the multi-modal and frequency-weighted tensor nuclear norm (MFWTNN) and the non-convex MFWTNN for HSI denoising tasks.

90, TITLE: STRESS: Super-Resolution for Dynamic Fetal MRI Using Self-Supervised Learning
AUTHORS: Junshen Xu ; Esra Abaci Turk ; P. Ellen Grant ; Polina Golland ; Elfar Adalsteinsson
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice acquisitions.

91, TITLE: High-Throughput Precision Phenotyping of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy with Cardiovascular Deep Learning
AUTHORS: GRANT DUFFY et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To overcome this challenge, we present EchoNet-LVH - a deep learning workflow that automatically quantifies ventricular hypertrophy with precision equal to human experts and predicts etiology of LVH.

92, TITLE: FoldIt: Haustral Folds Detection and Segmentation in Colonoscopy Videos
AUTHORS: Shawn Mathew ; Saad Nadeem ; Arie Kaufman
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a novel generative adversarial network, FoldIt, for feature-consistent image translation of optical colonoscopy videos to virtual colonoscopy renderings with haustral fold overlays.

93, TITLE: Learning from Pseudo Lesion: A Self-supervised Framework for COVID-19 Diagnosis
AUTHORS: Zhongliang Li ; Zhihao Jin ; Xuechen Li ; Linlin Shen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Inspired by Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), a common finding in COIVD-19 patient's CT scans, we proposed in this paper a novel self-supervised pretraining method based on pseudo lesions generation and restoration for COVID-19 diagnosis.

94, TITLE: CxSE: Chest X-ray Slow Encoding CNN ForCOVID-19 Diagnosis
AUTHORS: Thangarajah Akilan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This work proposes a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called 'slow Encoding CNN.
