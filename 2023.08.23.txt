In view of this, we aim at extending tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings, where a comprehensive cost has to be computed from heterogeneous information e.g., 2D motion cues, visual appearance, and pose estimates.

159, TITLE: Low Tensor Rank Learning of Neural Dynamics
AUTHORS: Arthur Pellegrino ; N Alex Cayco-Gajic ; Angus Chadwick
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.LG, cs.NE, math.DS, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: By fitting RNNs of varying rank to large-scale neural recordings during a motor learning task, we find that the inferred weights are low-tensor-rank and therefore evolve over a fixed low-dimensional subspace throughout the entire course of learning. We next validate the observation of low-tensor-rank learning on an RNN trained to solve the same task by performing a low-tensor-rank decomposition directly on the ground truth weights, and by showing that the method we applied to the data faithfully recovers this low rank structure.

160, TITLE: Interpretable Distribution-Invariant Fairness Measures for Continuous Scores
AUTHORS: Ann-Kristin Becker ; Oana Dumitrasc ; Klaus Broelemann
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose a distributionally invariant version of fairness measures for continuous scores with a reasonable interpretation based on the Wasserstein distance.

161, TITLE: Tensor Regression
AUTHORS: Jiani Liu ; Ce Zhu ; Zhen Long ; Yipeng Liu
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this book, the authors provide a systematic study and analysis of tensor-based regression models and their applications in recent years.

162, TITLE: NLP-based Detection of Systematic Anomalies Among The Narratives of Consumer Complaints
AUTHORS: Peiheng Gao ; Ning Sun ; Xuefeng Wang ; Chen Yang ; Ri?ardas Zitikis
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.CL, q-fin.RM, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: We develop an NLP-based procedure for detecting systematic nonmeritorious consumer complaints, simply called systematic anomalies, among complaint narratives.

163, TITLE: BundleSeg: A Versatile, Reliable and Reproducible Approach to White Matter Bundle Segmentation
AUTHORS: Etienne St-Onge ; Kurt G Schilling ; Francois Rheault
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This work presents BundleSeg, a reliable, reproducible, and fast method for extracting white matter pathways.

164, TITLE: EndoNet: Model for Automatic Calculation of H-score on Histological Slides
AUTHORS: EGOR USHAKOV et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we developed a model EndoNet for automatic calculation of H-score on histological slides.

165, TITLE: Open Set Synthetic Image Source Attribution
AUTHORS: Shengbang Fang ; Tai D. Nguyen ; Matthew C. Stamm
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To contend with this, there is a great need for open-set source attribution techniques that can identify when synthetic images have originated from new, unseen generators. To address this problem, we propose a new metric learning-based approach.

166, TITLE: Switched Auxiliary Loss for Robust Training of Transformer Models for Histopathological Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Mustaffa Hussain ; Saharsh Barve
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose adding shifted auxiliary loss for training models like the transformers to overcome the diminishing gradient problem which poses a challenge towards optimal training of deep models.

167, TITLE: Non-Redundant Combination of Hand-Crafted and Deep Learning Radiomics: Application to The Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer
AUTHORS: REBECA VÉTIL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We address the problem of learning Deep Learning Radiomics (DLR) that are not redundant with Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR).

168, TITLE: Harmonization Across Imaging Locations(HAIL): One-Shot Learning for Brain MRI
AUTHORS: ABHIJEET PARIDA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To prevent hallucination in medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we propose a one-shot learning method where we utilize neural style transfer for harmonization.

169, TITLE: PCMC-T1: Free-breathing Myocardial T1 Mapping with Physically-Constrained Motion Correction
AUTHORS: Eyal Hanania ; Ilya Volovik ; Lilach Barkat ; Israel Cohen ; Moti Freiman
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce PCMC-T1, a physically-constrained deep-learning model for motion correction in free-breathing T1 mapping.

170, TITLE: A Preliminary Investigation Into Search and Matching for Tumour Discrimination in WHO Breast Taxonomy Using Deep Networks
AUTHORS: ABUBAKR SHAFIQUE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we indexed and analyzed the WHO breast taxonomy (Classification of Tumours 5th Ed.)
