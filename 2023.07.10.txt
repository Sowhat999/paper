To tackle these issues, we propose a novel parameter-free graph clustering framework termed Unpaired Multi-view Graph Clustering framework with Cross-View Structure Matching (UPMGC-SM).

Towards an answer to this question, we study imitation learning policies in simulation and on a real robot language-conditioned manipulation task to quantify the difficulty of generalization to different (sets of) factors.

82, TITLE: SpawnNet: Learning Generalizable Visuomotor Skills from Pre-trained Networks
AUTHORS: Xingyu Lin ; John So ; Sashwat Mahalingam ; Fangchen Liu ; Pieter Abbeel
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior works have explored visual pre-training with different self-supervised objectives, but the generalization capabilities of the learned policies remain relatively unknown. In this work, we take the first step towards this challenge, focusing on how pre-trained representations can help the generalization of the learned policies.

83, TITLE: When Does The ID Algorithm Fail?
AUTHORS: Ilya Shpitser
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While the ID algorithm is, indeed, a sound and complete algorithm, and the hedge structure does arise whenever the input distribution is not identified, Corollary 3 presented in [9] is incorrect as stated. In this note, I outline the modern presentation of the ID algorithm, discuss a simple counterexample to Corollary 3, and provide a number of graphical characterizations of the ID algorithm failing to identify its input distribution.

84, TITLE: Gammatonegram Representation for End-to-End Dysarthric Speech Processing Tasks: Speech Recognition, Speaker Identification, and Intelligibility Assessment
AUTHORS: Aref Farhadipour ; Hadi Veisi
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we introduce gammatonegram as an effective method to represent audio files with discriminative details, which is used as input for the convolutional neural network.

85, TITLE: Motion Magnification in Robotic Sonography: Enabling Pulsation-Aware Artery Segmentation
AUTHORS: Dianye Huang ; Yuan Bi ; Nassir Navab ; Zhongliang Jiang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: To improve the artery segmentation accuracy and stability during scans, this work presents a novel pulsation-assisted segmentation neural network (PAS-NN) by explicitly taking advantage of the cardiac-induced motions.

86, TITLE: CheXmask: A Large-scale Dataset of Anatomical Segmentation Masks for Multi-center Chest X-ray Images
AUTHORS: NICOLÁS GAGGION et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: While several databases of chest X-ray images have been released, most include disease diagnosis labels but lack detailed pixel-level anatomical segmentation labels. To address this gap, we introduce an extensive chest X-ray multi-center segmentation dataset with uniform and fine-grain anatomical annotations for images coming from six well-known publicly available databases: CANDID-PTX, ChestX-ray8, Chexpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, Padchest, and VinDr-CXR, resulting in 676,803 segmentation masks.

87, TITLE: Empirical Analysis of A Segmentation Foundation Model in Prostate Imaging
AUTHORS: Heejong Kim ; Victor Ion Butoi ; Adrian V. Dalca ; Mert R. Sabuncu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we consider a recently developed foundation model for medical image segmentation, UniverSeg.

88, TITLE: Merging-Diverging Hybrid Transformer Networks for Survival Prediction in Head and Neck Cancer
AUTHORS: Mingyuan Meng ; Lei Bi ; Michael Fulham ; Dagan Feng ; Jinman Kim
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing deep survival models are not well developed in utilizing multi-modality images (e.g., PET-CT) and in extracting region-specific information (e.g., the prognostic information in Primary Tumor (PT) and Metastatic Lymph Node (MLN) regions). In view of this, we propose a merging-diverging learning framework for survival prediction from multi-modality images.

AUTHORS: Baoru Huang ; Yicheng Hu ; Anh Nguyen ; Stamatia Giannarou ; Daniel S. Elson
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution, we designed and implemented a simple regression network that successfully addressed the problem.

90, TITLE: Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion Using The Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
AUTHORS: Shuaikai Shi ; Lijun Zhang ; Jie Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a deep fusion method based on the conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model, called DDPM-Fus.
