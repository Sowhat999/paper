In this work, we carry out new and existing representation-level interventions to investigate the effect of these semantic features on NLI classification: we perform amnesic probing (which removes features as directed by learned linear probes) and introduce the mnestic probing variation (which forgets all dimensions except the probe-selected ones).

To address these issues, we develop a Complex Mixer (C-Mixer) with a pre-training framework to alleviate the problem of insufficient information and uncertainty in the label space by introducing an incentive imaginary matrix and a self-supervised scheme with random masking.
