43, TITLE: REVIVE: Regional Visual Representation Matters in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering
AUTHORS: YUANZE LIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, we observe that in most state-of-the-art knowledge-based VQA methods: 1) visual features are extracted either from the whole image or in a sliding window manner for retrieving knowledge, and the important relationship within/among object regions is neglected; 2) visual features are not well utilized in the final answering model, which is counter-intuitive to some extent. Based on these observations, we propose a new knowledge-based VQA method REVIVE, which tries to utilize the explicit information of object regions not only in the knowledge retrieval stage but also in the answering model.

81, TITLE: Why Did This Model Forecast This Future? Closed-Form Temporal Saliency Towards Causal Explanations of Probabilistic Forecasts
AUTHORS: Chirag Raman ; Hayley Hung ; Marco Loog
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IT, math.IT]
HIGHLIGHT: In such settings, methods for explaining specific forecasts can enable domain experts to gain insights into the predictive relationships between behaviors. In this work, we introduce and address the following question: given a probabilistic forecasting model how can we identify observed windows that the model considers salient when making its forecasts?

82, TITLE: Robustness to Label Noise Depends on The Shape of The Noise Distribution in Feature Space
AUTHORS: Diane Oyen ; Michal Kucer ; Nick Hengartner ; Har Simrat Singh
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Machine learning classifiers have been demonstrated, both empirically and theoretically, to be robust to label noise under certain conditions -- notably the typical assumption is that label noise is independent of the features given the class label. We provide a theoretical framework that generalizes beyond this typical assumption by modeling label noise as a distribution over feature space.

83, TITLE: Feature Space Particle Inference for Neural Network Ensembles
AUTHORS: Shingo Yashima ; Teppei Suzuki ; Kohta Ishikawa ; Ikuro Sato ; Rei Kawakami

HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose optimizing particles in the feature space where the activation of a specific intermediate layer lies to address the above-mentioned difficulties.

84, TITLE: Improving Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems Using Manifold Constraints
AUTHORS: Hyungjin Chung ; Byeongsu Sim ; Dohoon Ryu ; Jong Chul Ye
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: By studying the generative sampling path, here we show that current solvers throw the sample path off the data manifold, and hence the error accumulates. To address this, we propose an additional correction term inspired by the manifold constraint, which can be used synergistically with the previous solvers to make the iterations close to the manifold.

85, TITLE: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Differential Privacy
AUTHORS: Dan Qiao ; Yu-Xiang Wang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the learned policy could retain sensitive information of individuals in the training data (e.g., treatment and outcome of patients), thus susceptible to various privacy risks. We design offline RL algorithms with differential privacy guarantees which provably prevent such risks.

86, TITLE: A DTCWT-SVD Based Video Watermarking Resistant to Frame Rate Conversion
AUTHORS: Yifei Wang ; Qichao Ying ; Zhenxing Qian ; Sheng Li ; Xinpeng Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.MM [cs.MM, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Among them, temporal synchronization attacks which include frame dropping, frame insertion and frame rate conversion is one of the most prevalent attacks. To address this issue, we present a new video watermarking based on joint Dual-Tree Cosine Wavelet Transformation (DTCWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is resistant to frame rate conversion.

87, TITLE: Distilling Knowledge from Object Classification to Aesthetics Assessment
AUTHORS: Jingwen Hou ; Henghui Ding ; Weisi Lin ; Weide Liu ; Yuming Fang
CATEGORY: cs.MM [cs.MM, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we point out that the major dilemma of image aesthetics assessment (IAA) comes from the abstract nature of aesthetic labels.

AUTHORS: Yin ShiYuan
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, 68T20, I.2.8]

89, TITLE: Beyond Accuracy: Generalization Properties of Bio-plausible Temporal Credit Assignment Rules
AUTHORS: Yuhan Helena Liu ; Arna Ghosh ; Blake A. Richards ; Eric Shea-Brown ; Guillaume Lajoie
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, q-bio.NC]
HIGHLIGHT: Next, we verify that such generalization performance is correlated significantly with loss landscape curvature, and we show that biologically-plausible learning rules tend to approach high-curvature regions in synaptic weight space. Using tools from dynamical systems, we derive theoretical arguments and present a theorem explaining this phenomenon.

90, TITLE: A Constraint and Object Oriented Fifth Generation Programming Language and Its Compiler and Runtime System
AUTHORS: Han Jipeng ; Lichen Zhihang
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, compared with the fourth generation programming language, the fifth generation programming language has not been widely used because of its obscure semantics, rigorous representation of problems, and limited inference ability. For this reason, COOL (Constraint and Object Ordered Language), a fifth generation programming language proposed in this paper, overcomes the problems of intuitive semantics, rigorous restrictions on handling problem conditions, and improves the inference ability of previous fifth generation programming languages.
