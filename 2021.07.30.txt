90, TITLE: Proposal-based Few-shot Sound Event Detection for Speech and Environmental Sounds with Perceivers
AUTHORS: Piper Wolters ; Chris Daw ; Brian Hutchinson ; Lauren Phillips
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.NE, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose novel approaches to few-shot sound event detection utilizing region proposals and the Perceiver architecture, which is capable of accurately localizing sound events with very few examples of each class of interest.

91, TITLE: Swap-Free Fat-Water Separation in Dixon MRI Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
AUTHORS: NICOLAS BASTY et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we propose such a method based on style transfer using a conditional generative adversarial network.

92, TITLE: Recurrent U-net for Automatic Pelvic Floor Muscle Segmentation on 3D Ultrasound
AUTHORS: Frieda van den Noort ; Beril Sirmacek ; Cornelis H. Slump
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study we present a U-net like neural network with some convolutional long short term memory (CLSTM) layers to automate the 3D segmentation of the levator ani muscle (LAM) in TPUS volumes.

93, TITLE: The Interpretation of Endobronchial Ultrasound Image Using 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Differentiating Malignant and Benign Mediastinal Lesions
AUTHORS: CHING et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The purpose of this study is to differentiate malignant and benign mediastinal lesions by using the three-dimensional convolutional neural network through the endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) image.

94, TITLE: A Similarity Measure of Histopathology Images By Deep Embeddings
AUTHORS: Mehdi Afshari ; H. R. Tizhoosh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study proposes a content-based similarity measure for high-resolution gigapixel histopathology images.
