We describe how to identify these groups, explore what sets them apart, and carefully study their effect on the network's optimization and behavior.

AUTHORS: XULONG WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, eess.IV]

167, TITLE: Low-Rank MDPs with Continuous Action Spaces
AUTHORS: Andrew Bennett ; Nathan Kallus ; Miruna Oprescu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: However, current methods for low-rank MDPs are limited in that they only consider finite action spaces, and give vacuous bounds as $|\mathcal{A}| \to \infty$, which greatly limits their applicability. In this work, we study the problem of extending such methods to settings with continuous actions, and explore multiple concrete approaches for performing this extension.

172, TITLE: Impact of HPO on AutoML Forecasting Ensembles
AUTHORS: David Hoffmann
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, I.2.6; I.2.2]
HIGHLIGHT: It shows that in such a setup, adding hyperparameter optimization can lead to performance improvements, with the final setup having a 9.9 % percent accuracy improvement with respect to the avg-wQL over the baseline ensemble without HPO, accompanied by a 65.8 % increase in end-to-end ensemble latency. This improvement is based on an empirical analysis of combining the ensemble pipeline with different tuning strategies, namely Bayesian Optimisation and Hyperband and different configurations of those strategies.

173, TITLE: Multitask Multimodal Prompted Training for Interactive Embodied Task Completion
AUTHORS: GEORGIOS PANTAZOPOULOS et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Interactive and embodied tasks pose at least two fundamental challenges to existing Vision & Language (VL) models, including 1) grounding language in trajectories of actions and observations, and 2) referential disambiguation. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Embodied MultiModal Agent (EMMA): a unified encoder-decoder model that reasons over images and trajectories, and casts action prediction as multimodal text generation.

CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI]

187, TITLE: Predicting Age from White Matter Diffusivity with Residual Learning
AUTHORS: CHENYU GAO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.NC]
HIGHLIGHT: Although early studies have sought to harness DTI's advantages for age estimation, there is no evidence that the success of this prediction is owed to the unique microstructural and diffusivity features that DTI provides, rather than the macrostructural features that are also available in DTI data. Therefore, we seek to develop white-matter-specific age estimation to capture deviations from normal white matter aging.
