To tackle these challenges, we propose PathFusion, consisting of two main components: (1) MSP, a unified modeling approach that simplifies the alignment process by constructing paths connecting entities and modality nodes to represent multiple modalities; (2) IRF, an iterative fusion method that effectively combines information from different modalities using the path as an information carrier.

To fill this gap, we introduce a new noise-robust approach, that 1)~incorporates a pre-trained GPT-2 into a sequence tagging scheme for simultaneous entity and relation detection, and 2)~employs a noise-robust learning framework which includes a new loss function that penalizes inconsistency with both significant relation patterns and entity-relation dependencies, as well as a self-adaptive learning step that iteratively selects and trains on high-quality instances.
