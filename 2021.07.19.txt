AUTHORS:	Takuya Higuchi ; Anmol Gupta ; Chandra Dhir
CATEGORY:	eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT:	In this paper, we introduce a cross attention decoder in the multi-task learning framework.

77, TITLE:	Exploiting
 Generative Self-supervised Learning for The Assessment of Biological 
Images with Lack of Annotations: A COVID-19 Case-study
AUTHORS:	Alessio Mascolini ; Dario Cardamone ; Francesco Ponzio ; Santa Di Cataldo ; Elisa Ficarra
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper we present GAN-DL, a Discriminator Learner based on the 
StyleGAN2 architecture, which we employ for self-supervised image 
representation learning in the case of fluorescent biological images.

78, TITLE:	Unpaired Cross-modality Educed Distillation (CMEDL) Applied to CT Lung Tumor Segmentation
AUTHORS:	Jue Jiang ; Andreas Rimner ; Joseph O. Deasy ; Harini Veeraraghavan
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Our contribution eliminates two requirements of distillation methods: 
(i) paired image sets by using an image to image (I2I) translation and 
(ii) pre-training of the teacher network with a large training set by 
using concurrent training of all networks.

79, TITLE:	Depth Estimation from Monocular Images and Sparse Radar Using Deep Ordinal Regression Network
AUTHORS:	Chen-Chou Lo ; Patrick Vandewalle
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We integrate sparse radar data into a monocular depth estimation model 
and introduce a novel preprocessing method for reducing the sparseness 
and limited field of view provided by radar.

80, TITLE:	NeXtQSM -- A Complete Deep Learning Pipeline for Data-consistent Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping Trained with Hybrid Data
AUTHORS:	FRANCESCO COGNOLATO et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:	Here we aim to overcome these limitations and developed a framework to solve the QSM processing steps jointly.

81, TITLE:	Joint Semi-supervised 3D Super-Resolution and Segmentation with Mixed Adversarial Gaussian Domain Adaptation
AUTHORS:	NICOLO SAVIOLI et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Here we propose a semi-supervised multi-task generative adversarial 
network (Gemini-GAN) that performs joint super-resolution of the images 
and their labels using a ground truth of high resolution 3D cines and 
segmentations, while an unsupervised variational adversarial mixture 
autoencoder (V-AMA) is used for continuous domain adaptation.

82, TITLE:	Lightness Modulated Deep Inverse Tone Mapping
AUTHORS:	Kanglin Liu ; Gaofeng Cao ; Jiang Duan ; Guoping Qiu
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we present a deep learning based iTM method that takes 
advantage of the feature extraction and mapping power of deep 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and uses a lightness prior to 
modulate the CNN to better exploit observations in the surrounding areas
 of the over-exposed regions to enhance the quality of HDR image 
reconstruction.

83, TITLE:	Deep Learning Based Hybrid Precoding in Dual-Band Communication Systems
AUTHORS:	Rafail Ismayilov ; Renato L. G. Cavalcante ; S?awomir Sta?czak
CATEGORY:	eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We propose a deep learning-based method that uses spatial and temporal 
information extracted from the sub-6GHz band to predict/track beams in 
the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band.
