AUTHORS: Xuan Wu ; Xinhao Zhu ; Yizheng Zhao ; Xinyu Dai
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The central challenge in neural-symbolic computing is to unify the formulation of neural learning and symbolic reasoning into a single framework with common semantics, that is, to seek a joint representation between a neural model and a logical theory that can support the basic grounding learned by the neural model and also stick to the semantics of the logical theory. In this paper, we propose differentiable fuzzy $\mathcal{ALC}$ (DF-$\mathcal{ALC}$) for this role, as a neural-symbolic representation language with the desired semantics.

HIGHLIGHT: Beyond text and image generation, in this work, we explore the possibility of utilizing text descriptions to guide speech synthesis.

164, TITLE: Ontology-aware Learning and Evaluation for Audio Tagging
AUTHORS: HAOHE LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SD, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: This study defines a new evaluation metric for audio tagging tasks to overcome the limitation of the conventional mean average precision (mAP) metric, which treats different kinds of sound as independent classes without considering their relations.

165, TITLE: Ultrasound Detection of Subquadricipital Recess Distension
AUTHORS: MARCO COLUSSI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: After framing the problem, we propose two different approaches: the first one adopts a one-stage object detection algorithm, while the second one is a multi-task approach with a classification and a detection branch.

166, TITLE: SRTGAN: Triplet Loss Based Generative Adversarial Network for Real-World Super-Resolution
AUTHORS: DHRUV PATEL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we introduce Triplet Loss-based Generative Adversarial Network hereafter referred as SRTGAN for Image Super-Resolution problem on real-world degradation.

167, TITLE: Classification of Melanocytic Nevus Images Using BigTransfer (BiT)
AUTHORS: Sanya Sinha ; Nilay Gupta
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, I.4.9]
HIGHLIGHT: An automated classification algorithm is proposed in the given research.

168, TITLE: DOLCE: A Model-Based Probabilistic Diffusion Framework for Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction
AUTHORS: JIAMING LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present DOLCE, a new deep model-based framework for LACT that uses a conditional diffusion model as an image prior.

169, TITLE: Attacking Image Splicing Detection and Localization Algorithms Using Synthetic Traces
AUTHORS: Shengbang Fang ; Matthew C Stamm
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a new GAN-based anti-forensic attack that is able to fool state-of-the-art splicing detection and localization algorithms such as EXIF-Net, Noiseprint, and Forensic Similarity Graphs.

170, TITLE: Towards Live 3D Reconstruction from Wearable Video: An Evaluation of V-SLAM, NeRF, and Videogrammetry Techniques
AUTHORS: David Ramirez ; Suren Jayasuriya ; Andreas Spanias
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: With the KITTI data, our primary contribution is a quantitative evaluation of 3D reconstruction computational speed when considering live video.

171, TITLE: High-Perceptual Quality JPEG Decoding Via Posterior Sampling
AUTHORS: Sean Man ; Guy Ohayon ; Theo Adrai ; Michael Elad
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we propose a different paradigm for JPEG artifact correction: Our method is stochastic, and the objective we target is high perceptual quality -- striving to obtain sharp, detailed and visually pleasing reconstructed images, while being consistent with the compressed input.
