AUTHORS: FAKAI WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we customize a multi-object labeling tool for multi-phase CT images, which is used to curate a large-scale dataset containing 1,631 patients with four-phase CT images, multi-organ masks, and multi-lesion (six major types of liver lesions confirmed by pathology) masks.

158, TITLE: 1M Parameters Are Enough? A Lightweight CNN-based Model for Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Binh-Duong Dinh ; Thanh-Thu Nguyen ; Thi-Thao Tran ; Van-Truong Pham
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we look for a lightweight U-Net-based model which can remain the same or even achieve better performance, namely U-Lite.

159, TITLE: DoseDiff: Distance-aware Diffusion Model for Dose Prediction in Radiotherapy
AUTHORS: YIWEN ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a distance-aware diffusion model (DoseDiff) for precise prediction of dose distribution.
