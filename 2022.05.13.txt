87, TITLE: "There Is Not Enough Information": On The Effects of Explanations on Perceptions of Informational Fairness and Trustworthiness in Automated Decision-Making

In this work, we conduct a human subject study to assess people's perceptions of informational fairness (i.e., whether people think they are given adequate information on and explanation of the process and its outcomes) and trustworthiness of an underlying ADS when provided with varying types of information about the system.

To overcome this difficulty, we propose a transformation technique that removes the ADT terms from CHCs and derives new sets of clauses that work on basic sorts only, such as integers and booleans.

111, TITLE: Causal Discovery Under A Confounder Blanket
AUTHORS: David Watson ; Ricardo Silva
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: For these applications, causal discovery algorithms typically require parametric restrictions or extreme sparsity constraints. We relax these assumptions and focus on an important but more specialized problem, namely recovering a directed acyclic subgraph of variables known to be causally descended from some (possibly large) set of confounding covariates, i.e. a $\textit{confounder blanket}$.

112, TITLE: De-biasing "bias" Measurement
AUTHORS: Kristian Lum ; Yunfeng Zhang ; Amanda Bower

HIGHLIGHT: In practice, it important to have high quality, human digestible measures of model performance disparities and associated uncertainty quantification about them that can serve as inputs into multi-faceted decision-making processes. In this paper, we show both mathematically and through simulation that many of the metrics used to measure group-wise model performance disparities are themselves statistically biased estimators of the underlying quantities they purport to represent.
