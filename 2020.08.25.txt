To generate such samples, we pose the problem as an optimization task, where the network weights are fixed and use a gradient descent based method to synthesize adversarial samples that are on the boundary of their true labels and the nearest wrong labels.

CATEGORY:       cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we introduce Auto-PyTorch, which brings the best of these two worlds together by jointly and robustly optimizing the architecture of networks and the training hyperparameters to enable fully automated deep learning (AutoDL). To thoroughly study our assumptions on how to design such an AutoDL system, we additionally introduce a new benchmark on learning curves for DNNs, dubbed LCBench, and run extensive ablation studies of the full Auto-PyTorch on typical AutoML benchmarks, eventually showing that Auto-PyTorch performs better than several state-of-the-art competitors on average.
