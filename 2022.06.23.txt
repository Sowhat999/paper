To answer this question, we propose a novel computational framework, Synchronized Activations (Sync-ACT), to couple the visual representation spaces and semantics between ANNs and BNNs in human brain based on naturalistic functional magnetic resonance imaging (nfMRI) data.

AUTHORS: RICHARD D. LANGE et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, the complexity of this trade-off is compounded in the heterogeneous graph case due to the disparate heterophily relationships between nodes of different types. To address these issues, we proposed a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture in which layers are derived from optimization steps that descend a novel relation-aware energy function.

AUTHORS: Chendi Qian ; Gaurav Rattan ; Floris Geerts ; Christopher Morris ; Mathias Niepert
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DS, cs.NE, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, current approaches either use all subgraphs of a given size, sample them uniformly at random, or use hand-crafted heuristics instead of learning to select subgraphs in a data-driven manner. Here, we offer a unified way to study such architectures by introducing a theoretical framework and extending the known expressivity results of subgraph-enhanced GNNs.

100, TITLE: The Influence of Local Search Over Genetic Algorithms with Balanced Representations
AUTHORS: Luca Manzoni ; Luca Mariot ; Eva Tuba
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: There is still no clear explanation of this phenomenon, although it is suspected that a balanced representation might yield a more irregular fitness landscape, where it could be more difficult for GA to converge to a global optimum. In this paper, we investigate this issue by adding a local search step to a GA with balanced operators, and use it to evolve highly nonlinear balanced Boolean functions.

103, TITLE: Decoupling The Ascending and Descending Phases in Abstract Interpretation
AUTHORS: Vincenzo Arceri ; Isabella Mastroeni ; Enea Zaffanella
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: The abstract (post-) fixpoint computation is classically divided into two phases: the ascending phase, using widenings as extrapolation operators to enforce termination, is followed by a descending phase, using narrowings as interpolation operators, so as to mitigate the effect of the precision losses introduced by widenings. In this paper we propose a simple variation of this classical approach where, to more effectively recover precision, we decouple the two phases: in particular, before starting the descending phase, we replace the domain $\mathbb{A}$ with a more precise abstract domain $\mathbb{D}$.

AUTHORS: YUHAO LU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: With the introduction of large-scale datasets, we discover that a single physical metric usually generates several discrete levels of grasp confidence scores, which cannot finely distinguish millions of grasp poses and leads to inaccurate prediction results. In this paper, we propose a hybrid physical metric to solve this evaluation insufficiency.
