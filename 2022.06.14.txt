111, TITLE: Indirect-Instant Attention Optimization for Crowd Counting in Dense Scenes
AUTHORS: Suyu Han ; Guodong Wang ; Donghua Liu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, its loss calculation process still falls short: 1)We can only produce one-dimensional 'pseudo labels' for attention, since the artificial threshold involved in the procedure is not robust; 2) The attention awaiting loss calculation is necessarily high-dimensional, and decreasing it by convolution will inevitably introduce additional learnable parameters, thus confusing the source of the loss. To this end, we devise a simple but efficient Indirect-Instant Attention Optimization (IIAO) module based on SoftMax-Attention , which transforms high-dimensional attention map into a one-dimensional feature map in the mathematical sense for loss calculation midway through the network, while automatically providing adaptive multi-scale fusion to feature pyramid module.
