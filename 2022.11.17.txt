90, TITLE: GLFF: Global and Local Feature Fusion for Face Forgery Detection
AUTHORS: Yan Ju ; Shan Jia ; Jialing Cai ; Haiying Guan ; Siwei Lyu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although existing detection methods have shown high performance in specific evaluation settings, e.g., on images from seen models or on images without real-world post-processings, they tend to suffer serious performance degradation in real-world scenarios where testing images can be generated by more powerful generation models or combined with various post-processing operations. To address this issue, we propose a Global and Local Feature Fusion (GLFF) to learn rich and discriminative representations by combining multi-scale global features from the whole image with refined local features from informative patches for face forgery detection.

AUTHORS: Taojiannan Yang ; Linjie Yang ; Xiaojie Jin ; Chen Chen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent neural architecture search (NAS) works proposed training-free metrics to rank networks which largely reduced the search cost in NAS. In this paper, we revisit these training-free metrics and find that: (1) the number of parameters (\#Param), which is the most straightforward training-free metric, is overlooked in previous works but is surprisingly effective, (2) recent training-free metrics largely rely on the \#Param information to rank networks.

111, TITLE: Comparative Learning: A Sample Complexity Theory for Two Hypothesis Classes
AUTHORS: Lunjia Hu ; Charlotte Peale
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CC, cs.DS, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: In many learning theory problems, a central role is played by a hypothesis class: we might assume that the data is labeled according to a hypothesis in the class (usually referred to as the realizable setting), or we might evaluate the learned model by comparing it with the best hypothesis in the class (the agnostic setting). Taking a step beyond these classic setups that involve only a single hypothesis class, we introduce comparative learning as a combination of the realizable and agnostic settings in PAC learning: given two binary hypothesis classes $S$ and $B$, we assume that the data is labeled according to a hypothesis in the source class $S$ and require the learned model to achieve an accuracy comparable to the best hypothesis in the benchmark class $B$.
