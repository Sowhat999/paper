28, TITLE:      Unified Models of Human Behavioral Agents in Bandits, Contextual Bandits and RL
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04544
AUTHORS:        Baihan Lin ; Guillermo Cecchi ; Djallel Bouneffouf ; Jenna Reinen ; Irina Rish
COMMENTS:       This article supersedes and extends our work arXiv:1706.02897 (MAB) and arXiv:1906.11286 (RL) into the Contextual Bandit (CB) framework. It generalized extensively into multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits and RL settings to create a unified framework of human behavioral agents
HIGHLIGHT:      Motivated by clinical literature of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, we propose here a more general and flexible parametric framework for sequential decision making that involves a two-stream reward processing mechanism.
