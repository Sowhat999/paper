COMMENTS:       The first two authors contribute equally
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose Differentiable Sparsity Allocation (DSA), an efficient end-to-end budgeted pruning flow.

57, TITLE:      CineFilter: Unsupervised Filtering for Real Time Autonomous Camera Systems
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05636
AUTHORS:        Sudheer Achary ; Syed Ashar Javed ; Nikita Shravan ; K L Bhanu Moorthy ; Vineet Gandhi ; Anoop Namboodiri
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose two models, one a convex optimization based approach and another a CNN based model, both of which can exploit the temporal trends in the camera behavior.
