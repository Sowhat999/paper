HIGHLIGHT: As a result, a single training session only supports a fixed factor and has poor generalization ability. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Feature-Enhanced Implicit Neural Representation (FFEINR) for spatio-temporal super-resolution of flow field data.

HIGHLIGHT: However, the model-based method suffers from high computational complexity and performance degradation due to required approximations. In this work, we propose a novel neural network (NN-)based equalization approach, referred to as SICNN, which is designed by deep unfolding of a model-based iterative SIC method, eliminating the main disadvantages of its model-based counterpart.
