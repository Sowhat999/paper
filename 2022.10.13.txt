We study, for a number of standard pooling operators, under what conditions they are compatible with this idea, which we call the epistemic pooling principle.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: To generate this style-masked prior, we use "Explainable Attention" as our choice of attribution for a more precise style-masking step and also introduce a cost-effective and accurate "Attribution-Surplus" method of determining the position of masks from any arbitrary attribution model in O(1) time. We empirically show that this non-generational approach well suites the "content preserving" criteria for a task like TST, even for a complex style like Discourse Manipulation.

We study these details across three key dimensions: (1) Encoding architectures: Cross-Encoder vs Bi-Encoders; (2) Similarity function: Parameterized (i.e., trainable) functions vs non-parameterized function; (3) Training regimes: Episodic meta-learning vs the straightforward (i.e., non-episodic) training.

AUTHORS: Ting Jiang ; Deqing Wang ; Fuzhen Zhuang

HIGHLIGHT: We make the observation that the large gap in performance between two-stage and one-stage FSODs are mainly due to their weak discriminability, which is explained by a small post-fusion receptive field and a small number of foreground samples in the loss function. To address these limitations, we propose the Few-shot RetinaNet (FSRN) that consists of: a multi-way support training strategy to augment the number of foreground samples for dense meta-detectors, an early multi-level feature fusion providing a wide receptive field that covers the whole anchor area and two augmentation techniques on query and source images to enhance transferability.

137, TITLE: Hierarchical Instance Mixing Across Domains in Aerial Segmentation
AUTHORS: Edoardo Arnaudo ; Antonio Tavera ; Fabrizio Dominici ; Carlo Masone ; Barbara Caputo
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We investigate the task of unsupervised domain adaptation in aerial semantic segmentation and discover that the current state-of-the-art algorithms designed for autonomous driving based on domain mixing do not translate well to the aerial setting. This is due to two factors: (i) a large disparity in the extension of the semantic categories, which causes a domain imbalance in the mixed image, and (ii) a weaker structural consistency in aerial scenes than in driving scenes since the same scene might be viewed from different perspectives and there is no well-defined and repeatable structure of the semantic elements in the images.

169, TITLE: Deep Counterfactual Estimation with Categorical Background Variables
AUTHORS: Edward De Brouwer
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ME]

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CV]

AUTHORS: Mikael Henaff ; Roberta Raileanu ; Minqi Jiang ; Tim Rocktäschel
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

172, TITLE: Entity Aware Negative Sampling with Auxiliary Loss of False Negative Prediction for Knowledge Graph Embedding
AUTHORS: Sang-Hyun Je
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel method called Entity Aware Negative Sampling (EANS), which is able to sample negative entities resemble to positive one by adopting Gaussian distribution to the aligned entity index space.

173, TITLE: Gradient-Guided Importance Sampling for Learning Binary Energy-Based Models
AUTHORS: Meng Liu ; Haoran Liu ; Shuiwang Ji

Motivated from these limitations, in this study, we propose ratio matching with gradient-guided importance sampling (RMwGGIS).

175, TITLE: Predictive Querying for Autoregressive Neural Sequence Models
AUTHORS: Alex Boyd ; Sam Showalter ; Stephan Mandt ; Padhraic Smyth
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This is in part due to the fact that future querying involves marginalization over large path spaces, which is not straightforward to do efficiently in such models. In this paper we introduce a general typology for predictive queries in neural autoregressive sequence models and show that such queries can be systematically represented by sets of elementary building blocks.

CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While this is useful for matching images to natural language descriptions of object goals, it remains disjoint from the process of mapping the environment, so that it lacks the spatial precision of classic geometric maps. To address this problem, we propose VLMaps, a spatial map representation that directly fuses pretrained visual-language features with a 3D reconstruction of the physical world.

203, TITLE: Quantifying Uncertainty with Probabilistic Machine Learning Modeling in Wireless Sensing
AUTHORS: Amit Kachroo ; Sai Prashanth Chinnapalli
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Developing ML systems with probabilistic modeling can solve this problem easily, where one can quantify uncertainty whether it is arising from the data (irreducible error or aleotoric uncertainty) or from the model itself (reducible or epistemic uncertainty). This paper describes the idea behind these types of uncertainty quantification in detail and uses a real example of WiFi channel state information (CSI) based sensing for motion/no-motion cases to demonstrate the uncertainty modeling.
