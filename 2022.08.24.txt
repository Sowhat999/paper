In this paper, we conceptualize this line of thought and develop a unified framework to (1) estimate the distribution differences of observed variables across groups; (2) model the LatGIVs from the different treatment assignment mechanisms; and (3) plug LatGIVs to estimate the treatment-response function.

AUTHORS: Yanxu Hu ; Andy J. Ma
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]

86, TITLE: Flat Multi-modal Interaction Transformer for Named Entity Recognition
AUTHORS: Junyu Lu ; Dixiang Zhang ; Pingjian Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in dominant MNER approaches, the interaction of different modalities is usually carried out through the alternation of self-attention and cross-attention or over-reliance on the gating machine, which results in imprecise and biased correspondence between fine-grained semantic units of text and image. To address this issue, we propose a Flat Multi-modal Interaction Transformer (FMIT) for MNER.

87, TITLE: Learning from Noisy Labels with Coarse-to-Fine Sample Credibility Modeling
AUTHORS: BOSHEN ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Since it is practically impossible to categorize all noisy samples correctly, we further process them in a fine-grained manner via modeling the credibility of each sample. Specifically, for the clean set, we deliberately design a memory-based modulation scheme to dynamically adjust the contribution of each sample in terms of its historical credibility sequence during training, thus alleviating the effect from noisy samples incorrectly grouped into the clean set.

88, TITLE: Hierarchical Perceptual Noise Injection for Social Media Fingerprint Privacy Protection
AUTHORS: SIMIN LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]

In this work, we formalize this task as a statistical inverse problem: Given model deviation from the expected value, infer the responsibility score of each of the input variables.

CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE, cs.NI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their satisfactory performance is not without prior anchor link information and/or node attributes, which may not always be available. In this paper, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method using node attribute augmentation that is quite robust to the absence of such additional information.

HIGHLIGHT: (2) The inductive bias of the convolutional layer cannot be adapted to complex edge changes and the aggregation of multiple-segmented areas, resulting in its performance improvement mostly limited to segmenting the body of segmented areas instead of the edge. To address these challenges, we propose the CM-MLP framework on MFI (Multi-scale Feature Interaction) block and ACRE (Axial Context Relation Encoder) block for accurate segmentation of the edge of medical image.
