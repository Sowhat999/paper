http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05264
AUTHORS:        Massimo Equi ; Roberto Grossi ; Veli Mäkinen
COMMENTS:       Using Lemma 12 and Lemma 13 might to be enough to prove Lemma 14. However, the proof of Lemma 14 is correct if you assume that the graph used in the reduction is a DAG. Hence, since the problem is already quadratic for a DAG and a binary alphabet, it has to be quadratic also for a general graph and a binary alphabet
HIGHLIGHT:      We describe a simple conditional lower bound that, for any constant $\epsilon>0$, an $O(|E|^{1 - \epsilon} \, m)$-time or an $O(|E| \, m^{1 - \epsilon})$-time algorithm for exact pattern matching on graphs, with node labels and patterns drawn from a binary alphabet, cannot be achieved unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false.
