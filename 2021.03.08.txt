99, TITLE: Environmental Sound Classification on The Edge: Deep Acoustic Networks for Extremely Resource-Constrained Devices
AUTHORS: Md Mohaimenuzzaman ; Christoph Bergmeir ; Ian Thomas West ; Bernd Meyer
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: We present an edge solution for audio classification that achieves close to state-of-the-art performance on ESC-50, the same benchmark used to assess large, non resource-constrained networks.

100, TITLE: Slow-Fast Auditory Streams For Audio Recognition
AUTHORS: Evangelos Kazakos ; Arsha Nagrani ; Andrew Zisserman ; Dima Damen
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, eess.AS]

101, TITLE: FedDis: Disentangled Federated Learning for Unsupervised Brain Pathology Segmentation
AUTHORS: Cosmin I. Bercea ; Benedikt Wiestler ; Daniel Rueckert ; Shadi Albarqouni
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we leverage healthy brain scans of 623 subjects from multiple sites with real data (OASIS, ADNI) in a privacy-preserving fashion to learn a model of normal anatomy, that allows to segment abnormal structures.

102, TITLE: Study Group Learning: Improving Retinal Vessel Segmentation Trained with Noisy Labels
AUTHORS: Yuqian Zhou ; Hanchao Yu ; Humphrey Shi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a Study Group Learning (SGL) scheme to improve the robustness of the model trained on noisy labels.

103, TITLE: SpecTr: Spectral Transformer for Hyperspectral Pathology Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: BOXIANG YUN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To assist spectral context learning procedure, we introduce two important strategies: (1) a sparsity scheme enforces the learned contextual relationship to be sparse, so as to eliminates the distraction from the redundant bands; (2) a spectral normalization, a separate group normalization for each spectral band, mitigates the nuisance caused by heterogeneous underlying distributions of bands.

AUTHORS: ANANYA JANA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning method to address both problems.
