AUTHORS: Roi Cohen ; Eden Biran ; Ori Yoran ; Amir Globerson ; Mor Geva

To address this issue, we propose a novel set of evaluation criteria that consider the implications of an edit on related facts.

Coping with such a credit assignment challenge is one of the hallmark characteristics of reinforcement learning and, in this work, we capitalize on existing importance-sampling ratio estimation techniques for off-policy evaluation to drastically improve the handling of credit assignment with policy-gradient methods.

AUTHORS: Swastika Roy ; Hatim Chergui ; Christos Verikoukis

HIGHLIGHT: But there is a trade-off between AI performance and explainability, posing a dilemma for trustworthy 6G network slicing because the stakeholders require both highly performing AI models for efficient resource allocation and explainable decision-making to ensure fairness, accountability, and compliance. To balance this trade off and inspired by the closed loop automation and XAI methodologies, this paper presents a novel explanation-guided in-hoc federated learning (FL) approach where a constrained resource allocation model and an explainer exchange -- in a closed loop (CL) fashion -- soft attributions of the features as well as inference predictions to achieve a transparent 6G network slicing resource management in a RAN-Edge setup under non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets.

238, TITLE: PartDiff: Image Super-resolution with Partial Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: Kai Zhao ; Alex Ling Yu Hung ; Kaifeng Pang ; Haoxin Zheng ; Kyunghyun Sung
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite their impressive performance, diffusion-based generative models suffer from high computational costs due to the large number of denoising steps.In this paper, we first observed that the intermediate latent states gradually converge and become indistinguishable when diffusing a pair of low- and high-resolution images. This observation inspired us to propose the Partial Diffusion Model (PartDiff), which diffuses the image to an intermediate latent state instead of pure random noise, where the intermediate latent state is approximated by the latent of diffusing the low-resolution image.

239, TITLE: ES2Net: An Efficient Spectral-Spatial Network for Hyperspectral Image Change Detection
AUTHORS: Qingren Yao ; Yuan Zhou ; Wei Xiang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end efficient spectral-spatial change detection network (ES2Net) to address these issues.

CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP, 68T45, 68T07, I.4.9; I.5.4; I.2]
HIGHLIGHT: Worse still, some studies lack available code or reproducibility, making it difficult to fairly evaluate and compare performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a benchmarking framework to evaluate various rPPG techniques across a wide range of datasets for fair evaluation and comparison, including both conventional non-deep neural network (non-DNN) and deep neural network (DNN) methods.

244, TITLE: Automatic Lobe Segmentation Using Attentive Cross Entropy and End-to-end Fissure Generation
AUTHORS: Qi Su ; Na Wang ; Jiawen Xie ; Yinan Chen ; Xiaofan Zhang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The automatic lung lobe segmentation algorithm is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases, however, which has great challenges due to the incompleteness of pulmonary fissures in lung CT images and the large variability of pathological features. Therefore, we propose a new automatic lung lobe segmentation framework, in which we urge the model to pay attention to the area around the pulmonary fissure during the training process, which is realized by a task-specific loss function.

252, TITLE: ResWCAE: Biometric Pattern Image Denoising Using Residual Wavelet-Conditioned Autoencoder
AUTHORS: Youzhi Liang ; Wen Liang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms designed for generic image denoising have shown promise, their large number of parameters and lack of optimization for unique biometric pattern retrieval make them unsuitable for these devices and scenarios. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight and robust deep learning architecture, the Residual Wavelet-Conditioned Convolutional Autoencoder (Res-WCAE) with a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) regularization, designed specifically for fingerprint image denoising.
