HIGHLIGHT: However, there are two main limitations to overcome: firstly, the unrolled model structure and GPU memory constraints restrict the capacity of each denoising block in the network, impeding the effective extraction of detailed features for reconstruction; secondly, the existing model lacks the flexibility to adapt to variations in the input, such as different contrasts, resolutions or views, necessitating the training of separate models for each input type, which is inefficient and may lead to insufficient reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a two-stage MRI reconstruction pipeline to address these limitations.
