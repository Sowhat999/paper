To address these shortcomings, we proposed a novel network architecture with compound-attention and neighbor matching (CANM-Net) for multi-contrast MRI SR: The compound self-attention mechanism effectively captures the dependencies in both spatial and channel dimension; the neighborhood-based feature-matching modules are exploited to match degraded features and adjacent reference features and then fuse them to obtain the high-quality images.
