1, TITLE: Complexity of The Guided Local Hamiltonian Problem: Improved Parameters and Extension to Excited States
AUTHORS: Chris Cade ; Marten Folkertsma ; Jordi Weggemans
CATEGORY: quant-ph [quant-ph, cs.CC]
HIGHLIGHT: Recently it was shown that the so-called guided local Hamiltonian problem -- estimating the smallest eigenvalue of a $k$-local Hamiltonian when provided with a description of a quantum state ('guiding state') that is guaranteed to have substantial overlap with the true groundstate -- is BQP-complete for $k \geq 6$ when the required precision is inverse polynomial in the system size $n$, and remains hard even when the overlap of the guiding state with the groundstate is close to a constant $\left(\frac12 - \Omega\left(\frac{1}{\mathop{poly}(n)}\right)\right)$. We improve upon this result in three ways: by showing that it remains BQP-complete when i) the Hamiltonian is 2-local, ii) the overlap between the guiding state and target eigenstate is as large as $1 - \Omega\left(\frac{1}{\mathop{poly}(n)}\right)$, and iii) when one is interested in estimating energies of excited states, rather than just the groundstate.

2, TITLE: Improved Hardness Results for The Guided Local Hamiltonian Problem
AUTHORS: Sevag Gharibian ; Ryu Hayakawa ; François Le Gall ; Tomoyuki Morimae
CATEGORY: quant-ph [quant-ph, cs.CC]
HIGHLIGHT: Gharibian and Le Gall showed quantum advantage (more precisely, BQP-completeness) for GLH with $6$-local Hamiltonians when the guiding vector has overlap (inverse-polynomially) close to 1/2 with a ground state. In this paper, we optimally improve both the locality and the overlap parameters: we show that this quantum advantage (BQP-completeness) persists even with 2-local Hamiltonians, and even when the guiding vector has overlap (inverse-polynomially) close to 1 with a ground state.
