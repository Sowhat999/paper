33, TITLE:      Computational Complexity of Synchronization under Regular Commutative Constraints
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04042
AUTHORS:        Stefan Hoffmann
COMMENTS:       Published in COCOON 2020 (The 26th International Computing and Combinatorics Conference); 2nd version is update of the published version and 1st version; both contain a minor error, the assumption of maximality in the NP-c and PSPACE-c results (propositions 5 & 6) is missing, and of incomparability of the vectors in main theorem; fixed in this version. See (new) discussion after main theorem
