HIGHLIGHT: Second, we devise two types of uncertainty in the problem to increase performance and convey better trust: 1) we propose a method for modeling aleatoric uncertainty by using uncertainty priors to inject knowledge about the behavior of uncertainty. This focuses the capacity of the model in the direction of more meaningful supervision while reducing the number of learned parameters and improving stability; 2) we introduce a novel approach for quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of any model through clustering and measuring the entropy of its assignments.

AUTHORS: Benjamin L. Badger
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NA, math.NA]
HIGHLIGHT: Adversarial examples have been found for various deep as well as shallow learning models, and have at various times been suggested to be either fixable model-specific bugs, or else inherent dataset feature, or both. We present theoretical and empirical results to show that adversarial examples are approximate discontinuities resulting from models that specify approximately bijective maps $f: \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R^m; n \neq m$ over their inputs, and this discontinuity follows from the topological invariance of dimension.

AUTHORS: Anders Lansner ; Florian Fiebig ; Pawel Herman
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: The past decade has seen rising concerns about the shortcomings of sustained activity as the mechanism for short-term maintenance of WM information in the light of accumulating experimental evidence for so-called activity-silent WM and the fundamental difficulty in explaining robust multi-item WM. In consequence, alternative theories are now explored mostly in the direction of fast synaptic plasticity as the underlying mechanism.The question of non-Hebbian vs Hebbian synaptic plasticity emerges naturally in this context. In this review we focus on fast Hebbian plasticity and trace the origins of WM theories and models building on this form of associative learning.
