70, TITLE: Universal Domain Adaptive Object Detector
AUTHORS: Wenxu Shi ; Lei Zhang ; Weijie Chen ; Shiliang Pu

85, TITLE: Latents2Segments: Disentangling The Latent Space of Generative Models for Semantic Segmentation of Face Images
AUTHORS: Snehal Singh Tomar ; A. N. Rajagopalan
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, 68T45, I.2; I.4]
HIGHLIGHT: Few State of the Art (SOTA) methods which solve this problem, do so by incorporating priors with respect to facial structure or other face attributes such as expression and pose in their deep classifier architecture. Our endeavour in this work is to do away with the priors and complex pre-processing operations required by SOTA multi-class face segmentation models by reframing this operation as a downstream task post infusion of disentanglement with respect to facial semantic regions of interest (ROIs) in the latent space of a Generative Autoencoder model.

Under this insight, we propose a model-agnostic preconditioned diffusion sampling (PDS) method that leverages matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem.

AUTHORS: Adnan Ali ; Jinlong Li

To fix this issue, we introduce a Feature Based Adaptive Augmentation (FebAA) approach, which identifies and preserves potentially influential features and corrupts the remaining ones.
