91, TITLE: On The Use of Feature-maps and Parameter Control for Improved Quality-diversity Meta-evolution
AUTHORS: David M. Bossens ; Danesh Tarapore
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes an improved meta-evolution system such that (i) the database used to rapidly populate new archives is reformulated to prevent loss of quality-diversity; (ii) the linear transformation of base-features is generalised to a feature-map, a function of the base-features parametrised by the meta-genotype; and (iii) the mutation rate of the QD algorithm and the number of generations per meta-generation are controlled dynamically.

100, TITLE: AC-CovidNet: Attention Guided Contrastive CNN for Recognition of Covid-19 in Chest X-Ray Images
AUTHORS: Anirudh Ambati ; Shiv Ram Dubey

101, TITLE: Endmember-Guided Unmixing Network (EGU-Net): A General Deep Learning Framework for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Unmixing
AUTHORS: DANFENG HONG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Over the past decades, enormous efforts have been made to improve the performance of linear or nonlinear mixing models for hyperspectral unmixing, yet their ability to simultaneously generalize various spectral variabilities and extract physically meaningful endmembers still remains limited due to the poor ability in data fitting and reconstruction and the sensitivity to various spectral variabilities.

102, TITLE: Anomaly Detection By Autoencoder Based On Weighted Frequency Domain Loss
AUTHORS: Masaki Nakanishi ; Kazuki Sato ; Hideo Terada
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show our method's superiority over the conventional Autoencoder methods by comparing it with AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset.

103, TITLE: WeGleNet: A Weakly-Supervised Convolutional Neural Network for The Semantic Segmentation of Gleason Grades in Prostate Histology Images
AUTHORS: Julio Silva-Rodríguez ; Adrián Colomer ; Valery Naranjo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based system able to detect local cancerous patterns in the prostate tissue using only the global-level Gleason score during training.

104, TITLE: Self-learning for Weakly Supervised Gleason Grading of Local Patterns
AUTHORS: Julio Silva-Rodríguez ; Adrián Colomer ; Jose Dolz ; Valery Naranjo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Motivated by this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised deep-learning model, based on self-learning CNNs, that leverages only the global Gleason score of gigapixel whole slide images during training to accurately perform both, grading of patch-level patterns and biopsy-level scoring.
