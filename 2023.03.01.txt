90, TITLE: Efficient Masked Autoencoders with Self-Consistency
AUTHORS: ZHAOWEN LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, its high random mask ratio would result in two serious problems: 1) the data are not efficiently exploited, which brings inefficient pre-training (\eg, 1600 epochs for MAE $vs.$ 300 epochs for the supervised), and 2) the high uncertainty and inconsistency of the pre-trained model, \ie, the prediction of the same patch may be inconsistent under different mask rounds. To tackle these problems, we propose efficient masked autoencoders with self-consistency (EMAE), to improve the pre-training efficiency and increase the consistency of MIM.

AUTHORS: Markus Eisenbach ; Jannik Lübberstedt ; Dustin Aganian ; Horst-Michael Gross
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We will show that some well-performing attention blocks used in the state of the art are subject to inference costs that are far too high to justify their use for mobile robotic applications.

162, TITLE: RGB-D Grasp Detection Via Depth Guided Learning with Cross-modal Attention
AUTHORS: Ran Qin ; Haoxiang Ma ; Boyang Gao ; Di Huang
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address the two issues, this paper proposes a novel learning based approach to RGB-D grasp detection, namely Depth Guided Cross-modal Attention Network (DGCAN).

163, TITLE: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Pragmatic Communication and Control
AUTHORS: Federico Mason ; Federico Chiariotti ; Andrea Zanella ; Petar Popovski
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.NI, cs.SY, eess.SY, C.2.1; I.2.11]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a joint design that combines goal-oriented communication and networked control into a single optimization model, an extension of a multiagent POMDP which we call Cyber-Physical POMDP (CP-POMDP).

164, TITLE: MateRobot: Material Recognition in Wearable Robotics for People with Visual Impairments
AUTHORS: Junwei Zheng ; Jiaming Zhang ; Kailun Yang ; Kunyu Peng ; Rainer Stiefelhagen
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, knowing materials before touching is under-explored in the field of assistive technology. To fill this gap, in this work, a wearable robotic system, MateRobot, is established for PVI to recognize materials before hand.

165, TITLE: Safe-DS: A Domain Specific Language to Make Data Science Safe
AUTHORS: Lars Reimann ; Günter Kniesel-Wünsche
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.LG, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show how the wealth of Python DS libraries can be used in a statically safe way via Safe-DS, a domain specific language (DSL) for DS.

166, TITLE: CrossSpeech: Speaker-independent Acoustic Representation for Cross-lingual Speech Synthesis
AUTHORS: Ji-Hoon Kim ; Hong-Sun Yang ; Yoon-Cheol Ju ; Il-Hwan Kim ; Byeong-Yeol Kim
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose CrossSpeech which improves the quality of cross-lingual speech by effectively disentangling speaker and language information in the level of acoustic feature space.

167, TITLE: Exploring Self-supervised Pre-trained ASR Models For Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: SHUJIE HU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper explores a series of approaches to integrate domain adapted SSL pre-trained models into TDNN and Conformer ASR systems for dysarthric and elderly speech recognition: a) input feature fusion between standard acoustic frontends and domain adapted wav2vec2.0 speech representations; b) frame-level joint decoding of TDNN systems separately trained using standard acoustic features alone and with additional wav2vec2.0 features; and c) multi-pass decoding involving the TDNN/Conformer system outputs to be rescored using domain adapted wav2vec2.0 models.

168, TITLE: HalluAudio: Hallucinating Frequency As Concepts for Few-Shot Audio Classification
AUTHORS: Zhongjie Yu ; Shuyang Wang ; Lin Chen ; Zhongwei Cheng
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Few-shot audio classification is an emerging topic that attracts more and more attention from the research community. Most existing work ignores the specificity of the form of the audio spectrogram and focuses largely on the embedding space borrowed from image tasks, while in this work, we aim to take advantage of this special audio format and propose a new method by hallucinating high-frequency and low-frequency parts as structured concepts.

169, TITLE: Modern Bayesian Experimental Design
AUTHORS: Tom Rainforth ; Adam Foster ; Desi R Ivanova ; Freddie Bickford Smith
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.CO]
HIGHLIGHT: However, its deployment often poses substantial computational challenges that can undermine its practical use. In this review, we outline how recent advances have transformed our ability to overcome these challenges and thus utilize BED effectively, before discussing some key areas for future development in the field.

170, TITLE: Neural Video Compression with Diverse Contexts
AUTHORS: Jiahao Li ; Bin Li ; Yan Lu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: To boost NVC, this paper proposes increasing the context diversity in both temporal and spatial dimensions.

171, TITLE: Opto-UNet: Optimized UNet for Segmentation of Varicose Veins in Optical Coherence Tomography
AUTHORS: Maryam Viqar ; Violeta Madjarova ; Vipul Baghel ; Elena Stoykova
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This work proposes a segmentation model Opto-UNet, for segmenting the venous wall structure.

172, TITLE: DECOR-NET: A COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Network Improved By Emphasizing Low-level Features and Decorrelating Features
AUTHORS: Jiesi Hu ; Yanwu Yang ; Xutao Guo ; Ting Ma
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a DECOR-Net capable of capturing more decorrelated low-level features.

173, TITLE: Learnt Deep Hyperparameter Selection in Adversarial Training for Compressed Video Enhancement with Perceptual Critic
AUTHORS: Darren Ramsook ; Anil Kokaram
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Previously, no attention has been given to the problem of identifying which layers are most perceptually relevant. In this paper we present a new method for selecting perceptually relevant layers from such a network, based on a neuroscience interpretation of layer behaviour.

174, TITLE: Reconstruction-based Out-of-Distribution Detection for Short-Range FMCW Radar
