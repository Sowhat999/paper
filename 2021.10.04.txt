79, TITLE:	Powerpropagation: A Sparsity Inducing Weight Reparameterisation
AUTHORS:	Jonathan Schwarz ; Siddhant M. Jayakumar ; Razvan Pascanu ; Peter E. Latham ; Yee Whye Teh
CATEGORY:	stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]

sparse models.

80, TITLE:	Optic Disc Segmentation Using Disk-Centered Patch Augmentation
AUTHORS:	Saeid Motevali ; Aashis Khanal ; Rolando Estrada
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]

simple, yet novel training scheme for deep neural networks -- to address
 this problem.

81, TITLE:	Learning Multi-Site Harmonization of Magnetic Resonance Images Without Traveling Human Phantoms
AUTHORS:	Siyuan Liu ; Pew-Thian Yap
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We demonstrate with more than 6,000 multi-site T1- and T2-weighted 
images that our method is remarkably effective in generating images with
 realistic site-specific appearances without altering anatomical 
details.

83, TITLE:	DCT Based Fusion of Variable Exposure Images for HDRI
AUTHORS:	Vivek Ramakarishnan ; Dnyaneshwar Jageshwar Pete
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]

84, TITLE:	Noise2Recon: A Semi-Supervised Framework for Joint MRI Reconstruction and Denoising
AUTHORS:	ARJUN D DESAI et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	To alleviate this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised, 
consistency-based framework (termed Noise2Recon) for joint MR 
reconstruction and denoising.

85, TITLE:	Development
 of The Algorithm for Differentiating Bone Metastases and Trauma of The 
Ribs in Bone Scintigraphy and Demonstration of Visual Evidence of The 
Algorithm -- Using Only Anterior Bone Scan View of Thorax
AUTHORS:	Shigeaki Higashiyama ; Yukino Ohta ; Yutaka Katayama ; Atsushi Yoshida ; Joji Kawabe
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph, Primary, I.2.0]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In recent years, a method for visualizing diagnostic grounds called 
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) has been proposed 
in the area of diagnostic images using Deep Convolutional Neural Network
 (DCNN).

86, TITLE:	DeepMCAT: Large-Scale Deep Clustering for Medical Image Categorization
AUTHORS:	Turkay Kart ; Wenjia Bai ; Ben Glocker ; Daniel Rueckert
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically 
clustering and categorizing large-scale medical image datasets, with a 
focus on cardiac MR images, and without using any labels.

87, TITLE:	Preconditioned Plug-and-Play ADMM with Locally Adjustable Denoiser for Image Restoration
AUTHORS:	Mikael Le Pendu ; Christine Guillemot
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we extend the concept of plug-and-play optimization to 
use denoisers that can be parameterized for non-constant noise variance.

88, TITLE:	Learning of Inter-Label Geometric Relationships Using Self-Supervised Learning: Application To Gleason Grade Segmentation
AUTHORS:	Dwarikanath Mahapatra
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We propose a method to synthesize for PCa histopathology images by 
learning the geometrical relationship between different disease labels 
using self-supervised learning.
