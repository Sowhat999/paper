AUTHORS: Jongheon Jeong ; Seojin Kim ; Jinwoo Shin
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Under the smoothed classifiers, the fundamental trade-off between accuracy and (adversarial) robustness has been well evidenced in the literature: i.e., increasing the robustness of a classifier for an input can be at the expense of decreased accuracy for some other inputs. In this paper, we propose a simple training method leveraging this trade-off to obtain robust smoothed classifiers, in particular, through a sample-wise control of robustness over the training samples.

AUTHORS: Yingchun Wang ; Jingcai Guo ; Song Guo ; Weizhan Zhang ; Jie Zhang

In this paper, we propose a novel Spurious Feature-targeted model Pruning framework, dubbed SFP, to automatically explore invariant substructures without referring to the above weaknesses.

AUTHORS: Gallil Maimon ; Yossi Adi
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.LG, eess.AS]

249, TITLE: Quantum Algebra in R: The Weyl Package
AUTHORS: Robin K. S. Hankin

250, TITLE: Levelwise Construction of A Single Cylindrical Algebraic Cell
AUTHORS: JASPER NALBACH et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the shape and size of the cell produced depends on the order in which the polynomials are considered. This paper proposes a method to construct such cells levelwise, i.e. built level-by-level according to a variable ordering.

251, TITLE: Molecule Optimization Via Multi-objective Evolutionary in Implicit Chemical Space
AUTHORS: Xin Xia ; Yansen Su ; Chunhou Zheng ; Xiangxiang Zeng
CATEGORY: q-bio.BM [q-bio.BM, cs.LG, cs.NE]

252, TITLE: Annual Field-scale Maps of Tall and Short Crops at The Global Scale Using GEDI and Sentinel-2
AUTHORS: STEFANIA DI TOMMASO et. al.
CATEGORY: stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Independent reference data from around the world are then used to evaluate these GEDI-S2 maps. We find that GEDI-S2 performed nearly as well as models trained on thousands of local reference training points, with accuracies of at least 87% and often above 90% throughout the Americas, Europe, and East Asia.

253, TITLE: Near-optimal Policy Identification in Active Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: XIANG LI et. al.
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose the AE-LSVI algorithm for best-policy identification, a novel variant of the kernelized least-squares value iteration (LSVI) algorithm that combines optimism with pessimism for active exploration (AE).

254, TITLE: Fast Entropy-Based Methods of Word-Level Confidence Estimation for End-To-End Automatic Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: Aleksandr Laptev ; Boris Ginsburg
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.IT, cs.LG, math.IT]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a class of new fast non-trainable entropy-based confidence estimation methods for automatic speech recognition.

255, TITLE: BEATs: Audio Pre-Training with Acoustic Tokenizers
AUTHORS: SANYUAN CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: However, a semantic-rich acoustic tokenizer for general audio pre-training is usually not straightforward to obtain, due to the continuous property of audio and unavailable phoneme sequences like speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose BEATs, an iterative audio pre-training framework to learn Bidirectional Encoder representation from Audio Transformers, where an acoustic tokenizer and an audio SSL model are optimized by iterations.

256, TITLE: Shape Aware Automatic Region-of-Interest Subdivisions
AUTHORS: Timothy L. Kline
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present the results of applying our method to the medical image analysis of nested regions-of-interest of myocardial wall, where the subdivisions are used to study temporal and/or spatial heterogeneity of myocardial perfusion.
