AUTHORS: Thong Pham ; Shohei Shimizu ; Hideitsu Hino ; Tam Le

We propose a method that alleviates both issues simultaneously by leveraging a robust latent one-dimensional subspace of the original high-dimension space and exploiting the efficient estimation from the univariate causal model on such space.
