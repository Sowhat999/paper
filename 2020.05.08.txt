In addition, we propose a standard benchmark for NISQ computers based on qFlex.

41, TITLE:      Maximal Closed Set and Half-Space Separations in Finite Closure Systems
http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04417
AUTHORS:        Florian Seiffarth ; Tamas Horvath ; Stefan Wrobel
COMMENTS:       An early version of this paper was presented at ECML/PKDD 2019 and has appeared in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases - European Conference, ECML PKDD 2019
HIGHLIGHT:      As a first approach to overcome this negative result, we relax the problem to maximal closed set separation, give a greedy algorithm solving this problem with a linear number of closure operator calls, and show that this bound is sharp.

COMMENTS:       ACL 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      Our results highlight interesting differences between humans and language models: language models are more sensitive to number or gender alternations and synonym replacements than humans, and humans are more stable and consistent in their predictions, maintain a much higher absolute performance, and perform better on non-associative instances than associative ones.
