178, TITLE: A New Approach to Extracting Coronary Arteries and Detecting Stenosis in Invasive Coronary Angiograms
AUTHORS: CHEN ZHAO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We aim to develop an automatic algorithm by deep learning to extract coronary arteries from ICAs.In this study, a multi-input and multi-scale (MIMS) U-Net with a two-stage recurrent training strategy was proposed for the automatic vessel segmentation.
