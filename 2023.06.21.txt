The chapter discusses the potential risks and dangers of cultivating this co-creative ecosystem, such as the bias inherent in today's training data, potential quality degradation in future image generation systems due to synthetic data becoming common place, and the potential long-term effects of text-to-image generation on people's imagination, ambitions, and development.

HIGHLIGHT: This kind of bottom-up mechanistic modeling is still promising in the modern era of understanding the natural or artificial intelligence. Here, we shed light on eight challenges in developing theory of intelligence following this theoretical paradigm.

81, TITLE: Visually Grounded Few-shot Word Learning in Low-resource Settings
AUTHORS: Leanne Nortje ; Dan Oneata ; Herman Kamper
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a visually grounded speech model that learns new words and their visual depictions from just a few word-image example pairs.

82, TITLE: Deep Learning Methods for Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation: Evaluation on Images with Retinopathy of Prematurity
AUTHORS: GORANA GOJI? et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three high-performing convolutional neural networks for retinal blood vessel segmentation in the context of blood vessel segmentation on retinopathy of prematurity retinal images.

83, TITLE: Deep Learning Framework with Multi-Head Dilated Encoders for Enhanced Segmentation of Cervical Cancer on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging
AUTHORS: REZA KALANTAR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose a novel multi-head framework that uses dilated convolutions and shared residual connections for separate encoding of multiparametric MRI images.

84, TITLE: Low-complexity Multidimensional DCT Approximations
AUTHORS: V. A. Coutinho ; R. J. Cintra ; F. M. Bayer
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.MM, cs.SY, eess.SY, stat.ME]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce low-complexity multidimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT) approximations.

85, TITLE: Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Radiation Oncology
AUTHORS: LIAN ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we evaluate the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) model in clinical radiotherapy.

86, TITLE: Meta-Analysis of Transfer Learning for Segmentation of Brain Lesions
AUTHORS: SOVESH MOHAPATRA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We have implemented and tested a fully automatic method for stroke lesion segmentation which was developed using eight different 2D-model architectures trained via transfer learning (TL) and mixed data approaches.

87, TITLE: CAMP-Net: Context-Aware Multi-Prior Network for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction
AUTHORS: Liping Zhang ; Xiaobo Li ; Weitian Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite promising advances in deep learning-based MRI reconstruction methods, restoring high-frequency image details and textures remains a challenging problem for accelerated MRI. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel context-aware multi-prior network (CAMP-Net) for MRI reconstruction.

88, TITLE: To Fold or Not to Fold: Graph Regularized Tensor Train for Visual Data Completion
AUTHORS: Le Xu ; Lei Cheng ; Ngai Wong ; Yik-Chung Wu
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, to fully preserve the local information of the original visual data, we explore not folding the data tensor, and at the same time adopt graph information to regularize local similarity between nearby entries.
