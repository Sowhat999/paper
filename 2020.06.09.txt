129, TITLE:     The Criminality From Face Illusion
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03895
AUTHORS:        Kevin W. Bowyer ; Michael King ; Walter Scheirer
HIGHLIGHT:      Predicting criminality from face may initially seem similar to other facial analytics, but we argue that attempts to create a criminality-from-face algorithm are necessarily doomed to fail, that apparently promising experimental results in recent publications are an illusion resulting from inadequate experimental design, and that there is potentially a large social cost to belief in the criminality from face illusion.

HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a self-supervised Gaussian ATtention network for image Clustering (GATCluster).

105, TITLE:     Demographics Should Not Be the Reason of Toxicity: Mitigating Discrimination in Text Classifications with Instance Weighting
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14088
AUTHORS:        Guanhua Zhang ; Bing Bai ; Junqi Zhang ; Kun Bai ; Conghui Zhu ; Tiejun Zhao
COMMENTS:       Accepted by ACL 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we formalize the unintended biases in text classification datasets as a kind of selection bias from the non-discrimination distribution to the discrimination distribution.

HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we introduce a new evolutionary optimization algorithm based on Tukey's symmetric lambda distribution.

107, TITLE:     ProSelfLC: Progressive Self Label Correction for Training Robust Deep Neural Networks
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03788
AUTHORS:        Xinshao Wang ; Yang Hua ; Elyor Kodirov ; Neil M. Robertson
COMMENTS:       Open discussion: we show it's fine for a learner (student) to be confident towards a correct low entropy status. Then more research attention should be paid to the definition of correct knowledge, as in genera we accept, human annotations used for learning supervision may be biased, subjective, and wrong
HIGHLIGHT:      To resolve these issues, taking two well-accepted expertise: deep neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise [1] and minimum entropy regularisation principle [2], we propose a simple end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is endorsed by long learning time and high prediction confidence.

108, TITLE:     FBNetV3: Joint Architecture-Recipe Search using Neural Acquisition Function
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02049
AUTHORS:        Xiaoliang Dai ; Alvin Wan ; Peizhao Zhang ; Bichen Wu ; Zijian He ; Zhen Wei ; Kan Chen ; Yuandong Tian ; Matthew Yu ; Peter Vajda ; Joseph E. Gonzalez
HIGHLIGHT:      To address this oversight, we present JointNAS to search both (a) architectures and (b) their corresponding training recipes.

109, TITLE:     Boosting Adversarial Training with Hypersphere Embedding
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08619
AUTHORS:        Tianyu Pang ; Xiao Yang ; Yinpeng Dong ; Kun Xu ; Hang Su ; Jun Zhu
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we advocate incorporating the hypersphere embedding (HE) mechanism into the AT procedure by regularizing the features onto compact manifolds, which constitutes a lightweight yet effective module to blend in the strength of representation learning.
