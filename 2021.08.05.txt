CATEGORY:	stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Here we formalize the relationship between these two models and 
introduce a minimal Bayesian network representation of the staged tree, 
which can be used to read conditional independences in an intuitive way.

81, TITLE:	Recursive Fusion and Deformable Spatiotemporal Attention for Video Compression Artifact Reduction
AUTHORS:	Minyi Zhao ; Yi Xu ; Shuigeng Zhou
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, to boost artifact removal, on the one hand, we propose a
 Recursive Fusion (RF) module to model the temporal dependency within a 
long temporal range.

82, TITLE:	Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Retinal Vessel Segmentation with Adversarial Learning and Transfer Normalization
AUTHORS:	WEI FENG et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we explore unsupervised domain adaptation in retinal 
vessel segmentation by using entropy-based adversarial learning and 
transfer normalization layer to train a segmentation network, which 
generalizes well across domains and requires no annotation of the target
 domain.

83, TITLE:	Physics-based Noise Modeling for Extreme Low-light Photography
AUTHORS:	Kaixuan Wei ; Ying Fu ; Yinqiang Zheng ; Jiaolong Yang
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we systematically study the noise statistics in the 
imaging pipeline of CMOS photosensors, and formulate a comprehensive 
noise model that can accurately characterize the real noise structures.

84, TITLE:	MRI
 to PET Cross-Modality Translation Using Globally and Locally Aware GAN 
(GLA-GAN) for Multi-Modal Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease
AUTHORS:	Apoorva Sikka ; Skand ; Jitender Singh Virk ; Deepti R. Bathula
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end, globally and locally aware
 image-to-image translation GAN (GLA-GAN) with a multi-path architecture
 that enforces both global structural integrity and fidelity to local 
details.

85, TITLE:	Automatic Hemisphere Segmentation in Rodent MRI with Lesions
AUTHORS:	Juan Miguel Valverde ; Artem Shatillo ; Riccardo de Feo ; Jussi Tohka
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We present MedicDeepLabv3+, a convolutional neural network that is the 
first completely automatic method to segment brain hemispheres in 
magnetic resonance (MR) images of rodents with lesions.

86, TITLE:	Low-complexity Scaling Methods for DCT-II Approximations
AUTHORS:	D. F. G. Coelho ; R. J. Cintra ; A. Madanayake ; S. Perera
CATEGORY:	eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AR, cs.CC, cs.MM, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This paper introduces a collection of scaling methods for generating 
$2N$-point DCT-II approximations based on $N$-point low-complexity 
transformations.
