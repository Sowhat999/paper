AUTHORS:        Zhao Song ; David P. Woodruff ; Peilin Zhong

COMMENTS:       STOC 2017

HIGHLIGHT:      We study the $\ell_1$-low rank approximation problem, 
where for a given $n \times d$ matrix $A$ and approximation factor 
$\alpha \geq 1$, the goal is to output a rank-$k$ matrix $\widehat{A}$ 
for which $$\|A-\widehat{A}\|_1 \leq \alpha \cdot 
\min_{\textrm{rank-}k\textrm{ matrices}~A'}\|A-A'\|_1,$$ where for an $n
 \times d$ matrix $C$, we let $\|C\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^d 
|C_{i,j}|$.
