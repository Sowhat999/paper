We highlight this approximation's shortcomings and propose a novel guidance method: Direct Optimization of Diffusion Latents (DOODL), which enables plug-and-play guidance by optimizing diffusion latents w.r.t. the gradients of a pre-trained classifier on the true generated pixels, using an invertible diffusion process to achieve memory-efficient backpropagation.

159, TITLE: Symbolic Music Structure Analysis with Graph Representations and Changepoint Detection Methods
AUTHORS: Carlos Hernandez-Olivan ; Sonia Rubio Llamas ; Jose R. Beltran
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In the past, there have been several works that attempt to segment music into the audio and symbolic domains, however, the identification and segmentation of the music structure at different levels is still an open research problem in this area. In this work we propose three methods, two of which are novel graph-based algorithms that aim to segment symbolic music by its form or structure: Norm, G-PELT and G-Window.

160, TITLE: A Three-Player GAN for Super-Resolution in Magnetic Resonance Imaging
AUTHORS: QI WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose a new method for 3D SR based on the GAN framework.

161, TITLE: Scaled Quantization for The Vision Transformer
AUTHORS: Yangyang Chang ; Gerald E. Sobelman
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AR, cs.CV, I.4.9; B.2.4; B.2.2]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a robust method for the full integer quantization of vision transformer networks without requiring any intermediate floating-point computations.

162, TITLE: Adversarial Attack and Defense for Medical Image Analysis: Methods and Applications
AUTHORS: Junhao Dong ; Junxi Chen ; Xiaohua Xie ; Jianhuang Lai ; Hao Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Oppositely, recent years have also witnessed remarkable progress in defense against these tailored adversarial examples in deep medical diagnosis systems. In this exposition, we present a comprehensive survey on recent advances in adversarial attack and defense for medical image analysis with a novel taxonomy in terms of the application scenario.

163, TITLE: DisC-Diff: Disentangled Conditional Diffusion Model for Multi-Contrast MRI Super-Resolution
AUTHORS: Ye Mao ; Lan Jiang ; Xi Chen ; Chao Li
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a disentangled conditional diffusion model, DisC-Diff, for multi-contrast brain MRI super-resolution.

164, TITLE: CoLa-Diff: Conditional Latent Diffusion Model for Multi-Modal MRI Synthesis
AUTHORS: Lan Jiang ; Ye Mao ; Xi Chen ; Xiangfeng Wang ; Chao Li
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.3.3; I.4.10]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose the first diffusion-based multi-modality MRI synthesis model, namely Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model (CoLa-Diff).

165, TITLE: GQE-Net: A Graph-based Quality Enhancement Network for Point Cloud Color Attribute
AUTHORS: Jinrui Xing ; Hui Yuan ; Raouf Hamzaoui ; Hao Liu ; Junhui Hou
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To reduce color distortion in point clouds, we propose a graph-based quality enhancement network (GQE-Net) that uses geometry information as an auxiliary input and graph convolution blocks to extract local features efficiently.

166, TITLE: Adaptive Multi-scale Online Likelihood Network for AI-assisted Interactive Segmentation
AUTHORS: MUHAMMAD ASAD et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose an adaptive multi-scale online likelihood network (MONet) that adaptively learns in a data-efficient online setting from both an initial automatic segmentation and user interactions providing corrections.
