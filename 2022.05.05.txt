AUTHORS: Rujun Han ; Hong Chen ; Yufei Tian ; Nanyun Peng
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Two major issues in existing systems that exacerbate the challenges: 1) temporal bias in pertaining and story datasets that leads to monotonic event temporal orders; 2) lack of explicit guidance that helps machines decide where to insert flashbacks. We propose to address these issues using structured storylines to encode events and their pair-wise temporal relations (before, after and vague) as temporal prompts that guide how stories should unfold temporally.

32, TITLE: HiURE: Hierarchical Exemplar Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Relation Extraction
AUTHORS: SHULIANG LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing works either utilize self-supervised schemes to refine relational feature signals by iteratively leveraging adaptive clustering and classification that provoke gradual drift problems, or adopt instance-wise contrastive learning which unreasonably pushes apart those sentence pairs that are semantically similar. To overcome these defects, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learning.

33, TITLE: Modeling Task Interactions in Document-Level Joint Entity and Relation Extraction

AUTHORS: XIANHANG LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Nonetheless, interestingly, by taking a closer look at these from-scratch learned CNNs, we note there exist certain 3D kernels that exhibit much stronger appearance modeling ability than others, arguably suggesting appearance information is already well disentangled in learning. Inspired by this observation, we hypothesize that the key to effectively leveraging image pre-training lies in the decomposition of learning spatial and temporal features, and revisiting image pre-training as the appearance prior to initializing 3D kernels.
