AUTHORS: CHANGTONG ZAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We take the first step to investigate the complementarity between PT and RI in resource-rich scenarios via two probing analyses, and find that: 1) PT improves NOT the accuracy, but the generalization by achieving flatter loss landscapes than that of RI; 2) PT improves NOT the confidence of lexical choice, but the negative diversity by assigning smoother lexical probability distributions than that of RI. Based on these insights, we propose to combine their complementarities with a model fusion algorithm that utilizes optimal transport to align neurons between PT and RI.

In this work, we explore the poor performance of these models on a zero-shot cross-lingual visual question answering (VQA) task, where models are fine-tuned on English visual-question data and evaluated on 7 typologically diverse languages.

87, TITLE: DM$^2$S$^2$: Deep Multi-Modal Sequence Sets with Hierarchical Modality Attention
AUTHORS: Shunsuke Kitada ; Yuki Iwazaki ; Riku Togashi ; Hitoshi Iyatomi
CATEGORY: cs.MM [cs.MM, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, as the number of modalities increases, several potential problems with the mid-fusion model structure arise, such as an increase in the dimensionality of the concatenated multimodal features and missing modalities. To address these problems, we propose a new concept that considers multimodal inputs as a set of sequences, namely, deep multimodal sequence sets (DM$^2$S$^2$).

In this paper, we will face this problem, bridging the gap between physical simulation platforms and intelligent agent, connecting intelligent agents to a physical simulation platform, allowing agents to learn and complete drone flight tasks in a simulator that approximates the real world.
