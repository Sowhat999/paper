1, TITLE: MnEdgeNet -- Accurate Decomposition of Mixed Oxidation States for Mn XAS and EELS L2,3 Edges Without Reference and Calibration
AUTHORS: Huolin L. Xin ; Mike Hu
CATEGORY: cond-mat.mtrl-sci [cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.AI, cs.LG, physics.chem-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: For both EELS and XAS, 2+, 3+, 4+ reference spectra need to be taken on the same instrument/beamline and preferably in the same experimental session because the instrumental resolution and the energy axis offset could vary from one session to another. To circumvent this hurdle, in this study, we adopted a deep learning approach and developed a calibration-free and reference-free method to decompose the oxidation state of Mn L2,3 edges for both EELS and XAS.

HIGHLIGHT: It is known that computing the permanent $\mathop{\rm Per}(1+A)$, where $A$ is a finite-rank matrix requires a number of operations polynomial in the matrix size. I generalize this result to the expectation values $\left\langle\Psi| P(1+A) |\Psi\right\rangle$, where $P()$ is the multiplicative extension of a single-particle operator and $\left|\Psi\right\rangle$ is a product of a large number of identical finite bosonic states (i.e. bosonic states with a bounded number of bosons).

We present a new method called tag-set sequence learning to tackle this problem, where a tag-set sequence is a sequence of tag sets to capture the syntactic and semantic information of the underlying sentence, and a tag set consists of one or more language feature tags, including, for example, semantic-role-labeling, part-of-speech, named-entity-recognition, and sentiment-indication tags.

48, TITLE: Empathetic Dialogue Generation Via Sensitive Emotion Recognition and Sensible Knowledge Selection
AUTHORS: LANRUI WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

To address the above problems, we propose a Serial Encoding and Emotion-Knowledge interaction (SEEK) method for empathetic dialogue generation.

HIGHLIGHT: However, neural systems lack the interpretability of bag-of-words models; it is not trivial to connect a query change to a change in the latent space that ultimately determines the retrieval results. To shed light on this embedding space, we learn a "query decoder" that, given a latent representation of a neural search engine, generates the corresponding query.

161, TITLE: Valuing Vicinity: Memory Attention Framework for Context-based Semantic Segmentation in Histopathology
AUTHORS: OLIVER ESTER et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To take a step towards better context comprehension, we propose a patch neighbour attention mechanism to query the neighbouring tissue context from a patch embedding memory bank and infuse context embeddings into bottleneck hidden feature maps.

162, TITLE: Target Aware Poisson-Gaussian Noise Parameters Estimation from Noisy Images
AUTHORS: √âtienne Objois ; Kaan Okumu? ; Nicolas B√§hler
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this project, we use a Poisson-Gaussian noise model for the raw-images captured by the sensor, as it fits the physical characteristics of the sensor closely.

163, TITLE: Adversarial Transformer for Repairing Human Airway Segmentation
AUTHORS: Zeyu Tang ; Nan Yang ; Simon Walsh ; Guang Yang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Meanwhile, the diagnosis and prognosis of lung diseases often rely on evaluating structural changes in those anatomical regions. To address this gap, this paper presents a patch-scale adversarial-based refinement network that takes in preliminary segmentation along with original CT images and outputs a refined mask of the airway structure.
