CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To our best knowledge, this paper presents the first minimax lower bounds for distributed offline RL problems.

90, TITLE: Learning Latent Causal Dynamics
AUTHORS: Weiran Yao ; Guangyi Chen ; Kun Zhang
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a principled framework, called LiLY, to first recover time-delayed latent causal variables and identify their relations from measured temporal data under different distribution shifts.

91, TITLE: Cross-speaker Style Transfer for Text-to-speech Using Data Augmentation
AUTHORS: MANUEL SAM RIBEIRO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Our goal is to build a TTS system that is expressive, while retaining the target speaker's identity.

92, TITLE: The USTC-Ximalaya System for The ICASSP 2022 Multi-channel Multi-party Meeting Transcription (M2MeT) Challenge
AUTHORS: MAOKUI HE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose two improvements to target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD), the core component in our proposed speaker diarization system that was submitted to the 2022 Multi-Channel Multi-Party Meeting Transcription (M2MeT) challenge.

93, TITLE: Monotonically Convergent Regularization By Denoising
AUTHORS: Yuyang Hu ; Jiaming Liu ; Xiaojian Xu ; Ulugbek S. Kamilov
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent work has reported the state-of-the-art performance of RED in a number of imaging applications using pre-trained deep neural nets as denoisers.

94, TITLE: Multiclass Histogram-based Thresholding Using Kernel Density Estimation and Scale-space Representations
AUTHORS: S. Korneev ; J. Gilles ; I. Battiato
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a new method for multiclass thresholding of a histogram which is based on the nonparametric Kernel Density (KD) estimation, where the unknown parameters of the KD estimate are defined using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) iterations.

95, TITLE: Deep Learning for Computational Cytology: A Survey
AUTHORS: HAO JIANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To investigate the advanced methods and comprehensive applications, we survey more than 120 publications of DL-based cytology image analysis in this article.
