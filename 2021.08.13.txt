98, TITLE: Patchwork: Concentric Zone-based Region-wise Ground Segmentation with Ground Likelihood Estimation Using A 3D LiDAR Sensor
AUTHORS: Hyungtae Lim ; Minho Oh ; Hyun Myung
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To tackle the problem, this paper presents a novel ground segmentation method called \textit{Patchwork}, which is robust for addressing the under-segmentation problem and operates at more than 40 Hz.

99, TITLE: COVINS: Visual-Inertial SLAM for Centralized Collaboration
AUTHORS: Patrik Schmuck ; Thomas Ziegler ; Marco Karrer ; Jonathan Perraudin ; Margarita Chli
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.MA]

100, TITLE: Distributional Depth-Based Estimation of Object Articulation Models
AUTHORS: Ajinkya Jain ; Stephen Giguere ; Rudolf Lioutikov ; Scott Niekum
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a method that efficiently learns distributions over articulation model parameters directly from depth images without the need to know articulation model categories a priori.

101, TITLE: Robotic Testbed for Rendezvous and Optical Navigation: Multi-Source Calibration and Machine Learning Use Cases
AUTHORS: Tae Ha Park ; Juergen Bosse ; Simone D'Amico
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.LG]
