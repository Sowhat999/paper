AUTHORS: Mohamed Y. Eltabakh ; Mayuresh Kunjir ; Ahmed Elmagarmid ; Mohammad Shahmeer Ahmad
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.DB]

244, TITLE: Genetic Algorithms for Searching A Matrix of Metagrammars for Synthesis
AUTHORS: Yixuan Li ; Federico Mora ; Elizabeth Polgreen ; Sanjit A. ~Seshia
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this is highly dependent on the user providing such a template: a syntactic template that is too large results in a larger search space and slower synthesis, and a syntactic template that is too small may not contain the solution needed. In this work, we frame the space of syntactic templates as a matrix of rules, and demonstrate how this matrix can be searched effectively with little training data using simple search techniques such as genetic algorithms, giving improvements in both the number of benchmarks solved and solving time for the state-of-the-art synthesis solver.

252, TITLE: Masked Autoencoders with Multi-Window Attention Are Better Audio Learners
AUTHORS: Sarthak Yadav ; Sergios Theodoridis ; Lars Kai Hansen ; Zheng-Hua Tan
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: However, they do not address two key aspects of modelling multi-domain audio data: (i) real-world audio tasks consist of a combination of local+global contexts, and (ii) real-world audio signals are complex compositions of several acoustic elements with different time-frequency characteristics. To address these concerns, this work proposes a Multi-Window Masked Autoencoder (MW-MAE) fitted with a novel Multi-Window Multi-Head Attention module that can capture information at multiple local and global contexts in every decoder transformer block through attention heads of several distinct local and global windows.

253, TITLE: Adaptive Contextual Biasing for Transducer Based Streaming Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: TIANYI XU et. al.

To address this issue, we propose an adaptive contextual biasing method based on Context-Aware Transformer Transducer (CATT) that utilizes the biased encoder and predictor embeddings to perform streaming prediction of contextual phrase occurrences.

AUTHORS: Jaan Aru ; Matthew Larkum ; James M. Shine
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: Finally, while the previous two arguments can be overcome in future AI systems, the third one might be harder to bridge in the near future. Namely, we argue that consciousness might depend on having 'skin in the game', in that the existence of the system depends on its actions, which is not true for present-day artificial intelligence.

270, TITLE: Label- and Slide-free Tissue Histology Using 3D Epi-mode Quantitative Phase Imaging and Virtual H&E Staining
AUTHORS: TANISHQ MATHEW ABRAHAM et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.med-ph, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the process is laborious and time-consuming, often limiting its usage in crucial applications such as surgical margin assessment. To address these challenges, we combine an emerging 3D quantitative phase imaging technology, termed quantitative oblique back illumination microscopy (qOBM), with an unsupervised generative adversarial network pipeline to map qOBM phase images of unaltered thick tissues (i.e., label- and slide-free) to virtually stained H&E-like (vH&E) images.
