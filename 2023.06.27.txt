AUTHORS: Karthick Prasad Gunasekaran ; Kajal Tiwari ; Rachana Acharya
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.DB]
HIGHLIGHT: Managing the configurations of a database system poses significant challenges due to the multitude of configuration knobs that impact various system aspects.The lack of standardization, independence, and universality among these knobs further complicates the task of determining the optimal settings.To address this issue, an automated solution leveraging supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques was developed.This solution aims to identify influential knobs, analyze previously unseen workloads, and provide recommendations for knob settings.The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the evaluation of a new tool called OtterTune [1] on three different database management systems (DBMSs). The results indicate that OtterTune's recommendations are comparable to or even surpass the configurations generated by existing tools or human experts.In this study, we build upon the automated technique introduced in the original OtterTune paper, utilizing previously collected training data to optimize new DBMS deployments.By employing supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we focus on improving latency prediction.Our approach expands upon the methods proposed in the original paper by incorporating GMM clustering to streamline metrics selection and combining ensemble models (such as RandomForest) with non-linear models (like neural networks) for more accurate prediction modeling.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, I.2.7]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing datasets suffer from three issues, (i) mostly assuming that a new concept is pre-discovered and cannot support out-of-KB mention discovery; (ii) only using the concept label as the input along with the KB and thus lacking the contexts of a concept label; and (iii) mostly focusing on concept placement w.r.t a taxonomy of atomic concepts, instead of complex concepts, i.e., with logical operators. To address these issues, we propose a new benchmark, adapting MedMentions dataset (PubMed abstracts) with SNOMED CT versions in 2014 and 2017 under the Diseases sub-category and the broader categories of Clinical finding, Procedure, and Pharmaceutical / biologic product.

Based on these findings, we propose a novel sampling algorithm called Restart in order to better balance discretization errors and contraction.

Using this insight, we propose Score-Guided Planning (SGP), a planning algorithm for offline RL that utilizes score-matching to enable first-order planning in high-dimensional problems, where zeroth-order methods were unable to scale, and ensembles were unable to overcome local minima.
