167, TITLE: LECO: Learnable Episodic Count for Task-Specific Intrinsic Reward
AUTHORS: DAEJIN JO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, the interference from task-irrelevant observations in the episodic count may cause its intrinsic motivation to overlook task-related important changes of states, and the novelty in an episodic manner can lead to repeatedly revisit the familiar states across episodes. In order to resolve these issues, in this paper, we propose a learnable hash-based episodic count, which we name LECO, that efficiently performs as a task-specific intrinsic reward in hard exploration problems.

To tackle these challenges, we propose EDGE, which can quickly adapt to the recommendation for a new drug with limited prescription data from a few support patients.
