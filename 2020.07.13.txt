AUTHORS:        Sergio Vitale ; Giampaolo Ferraioli ; Vito Pascazio
COMMENTS:       Accepted to LAGIRS 2020

38, TITLE:      Estimating People Flows to Better Count Them in Crowded Scenes
http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10782
AUTHORS:        Weizhe Liu ; Mathieu Salzmann ; Pascal Fua
COMMENTS:       ECCV 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly regressing.

AUTHORS:        Xin Jin ; Cuiling Lan ; Wenjun Zeng ; Zhibo Chen
COMMENTS:       Accepted by ECCV2020
HIGHLIGHT:      To address this problem, we introduce a global distance-distributions separation (GDS) constraint over the two distributions to encourage the clear separation of positive and negative samples from a global view.

COMMENTS:       Code and models are available in the TensorFlow Object Detection API: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we question the optimality of this design pattern over a broad range of mobile accelerators by revisiting the usefulness of regular convolutions.

AUTHORS:        Qianli Shen ; Yan Li ; Haoming Jiang ; Zhaoran Wang ; Tuo Zhao
COMMENTS:       ICML 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      Motivated by the fact that many environments with continuous state space have smooth transitions, we propose to learn a smooth policy that behaves smoothly with respect to states.
