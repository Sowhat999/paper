HIGHLIGHT:      In this work we show that the Welded Tree Problem, which is an oracle problem that can be solved in quantum polynomial time as shown by Childs et al. (arXiv:quant-ph/0209131), cannot be solved in $\textrm{BPP}^{\textrm{BQNC}}$, nor can it be solved in the class that Jozsa describes.

42, TITLE:      A Benchmark on Tricks for Large-scale Image Retrieval

AUTHORS:        Byungsoo Ko ; Minchul Shin ; Geonmo Gu ; HeeJae Jun ; Tae Kwan Lee ; Youngjoon Kim
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we extensively analyze the effect of well-known pre-processing, post-processing tricks, and their combination for large-scale image retrieval.

AUTHORS:        Ke Lei ; Morteza Mardani ; John M. Pauly ; Shreyas S. Vasanawala
HIGHLIGHT:      To cope with this challenge, this paper leverages unpaired adversarial training for reconstruction networks, where the inputs are undersampled k-space and naively reconstructed images from one dataset, and the labels are high-quality images from another dataset.

AUTHORS:        Keting Lu ; Shiqi Zhang ; Xiaoping Chen
HIGHLIGHT:      Focusing on addressing this limitation, this paper makes a twofold contribution.

45, TITLE:      Aerial Images Processing for Car Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks: Comparison between Faster R-CNN and YoloV3
http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07234

46, TITLE:      Combined Model for Partially-Observable and Non-Observable Task Switching: Solving Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Problems Statically and Dynamically with Transfer Learning
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06213
AUTHORS:        Nibraas Khan ; Joshua Phillips
COMMENTS:       substantial text overlap with arXiv:1911.10425 which is the same as this paper. It was meant to be a revision of that paper, but I mistakenly submitted it as a new paper
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a new model, PONOWMtk, which combines both approaches, ATRs and input storage, with a static or dynamic number of ATRs.

47, TITLE:      On the Language Neutrality of Pre-trained Multilingual Representations
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05160
AUTHORS:        Jindřich Libovický ; Rudolf Rosa ; Alexander Fraser
COMMENTS:       11 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1911.03310
HIGHLIGHT:      We instead focus on the language-neutrality of mBERT with respect to lexical semantics.

48, TITLE:      Deep Learning for Screening COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray Images
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10507
AUTHORS:        Sanhita Basu ; Sushmita Mitra
HIGHLIGHT:      Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL).

49, TITLE:      Reasoning about Typicality and Probabilities in Preferential Description Logics
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09507
AUTHORS:        Laura Giordano ; Valentina Gliozzi ; Antonio Lieto ; Nicola Olivetti ; Gian Luca Pozzato
COMMENTS:       17 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1811.02366
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work we describe preferential Description Logics of typicality, a nonmonotonic extension of standard Description Logics by means of a typicality operator T allowing to extend a knowledge base with inclusions of the form T(C) v D, whose intuitive meaning is that normally/typically Cs are also Ds.

HIGHLIGHT:      The first Agriculture-Vision Challenge aims to encourage research in developing novel and effective algorithms for agricultural pattern recognition from aerial images, especially for the semantic segmentation task associated with our challenge dataset.

51, TITLE:      Improving Transformer Models by Reordering their Sublayers

AUTHORS:        Ofir Press ; Noah A. Smith ; Omer Levy
COMMENTS:       To appear at ACL 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a new transformer pattern that adheres to this property, the sandwich transformer, and show that it improves perplexity on multiple word-level and character-level language modeling benchmarks, at no cost in parameters, memory, or training time.

52, TITLE:      Game on Random Environment, Mean-field Langevin System and Neural Networks
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02457
AUTHORS:        Giovanni Conforti ; Anna Kazeykina ; Zhenjie Ren
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper we study a type of games regularized by the relative entropy, where the players' strategies are coupled through a random environment variable.

53, TITLE:      The Devil is in the Channels: Mutual-Channel Loss for Fine-Grained Image Classification

COMMENTS:       TIP2020. Code available at https://github.com/dongliangchang/Mutual-Channel-Loss

http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06618
AUTHORS:        Yihong Xu ; Aljosa Osep ; Yutong Ban ; Radu Horaud ; Laura Leal-Taixe ; Xavier Alameda-Pineda
COMMENTS:       14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a differentiable proxy of MOTA and MOTP, which we combine in a loss function suitable for end-to-end training of deep multi-object trackers.
