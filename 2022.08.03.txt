AUTHORS: Shivam Garg ; Dimitris Tsipras ; Percy Liang ; Gregory Valiant
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While large language models such as GPT-3 exhibit some ability to perform in-context learning, it is unclear what the relationship is between tasks on which this succeeds and what is present in the training data. To make progress towards understanding in-context learning, we consider the well-defined problem of training a model to in-context learn a function class (e.g., linear functions): that is, given data derived from some functions in the class, can we train a model to in-context learn "most" functions from this class?

AUTHORS: Beibei Lin ; Shunli Zhang ; Ming Wang ; Lincheng Li ; Xin Yu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although LFR allows the network to focus on the detailed posture information of each local region, it neglects the relations among different local parts and thus only exploits limited local information of several specific regions. To solve these issues, we propose a global-local based gait recognition network, named GaitGL, to generate more discriminative feature representations.

HIGHLIGHT: This paper aims to address a new task of image morphing under a multiview setting, which takes two sets of multiview images as the input and generates intermediate renderings that not only exhibit smooth transitions between the two input sets but also ensure visual consistency across different views at any transition state. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach called Multiview Regenerative Morphing that formulates the morphing process as an optimization to solve for rigid transformation and optimal-transport interpolation.

HIGHLIGHT: However, when deployed in the real world, the model will face unexpected, out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this work, we show that the so-called "radiologist-level" CheXnet model fails to recognize all OOD images and classifies them as having lung disease.
