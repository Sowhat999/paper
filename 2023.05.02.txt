52, TITLE: GeneFace++: Generalized and Stable Real-Time Audio-Driven 3D Talking Face Generation
AUTHORS: ZHENHUI YE et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: However, there still exist several challenges for NeRF-based methods: 1) as for the lip synchronization, it is hard to generate a long facial motion sequence of high temporal consistency and audio-lip accuracy; 2) as for the video quality, due to the limited data used to train the renderer, it is vulnerable to out-of-domain input condition and produce bad rendering results occasionally; 3) as for the system efficiency, the slow training and inference speed of the vanilla NeRF severely obstruct its usage in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose GeneFace++ to handle these challenges by 1) utilizing the pitch contour as an auxiliary feature and introducing a temporal loss in the facial motion prediction process; 2) proposing a landmark locally linear embedding method to regulate the outliers in the predicted motion sequence to avoid robustness issues; 3) designing a computationally efficient NeRF-based motion-to-video renderer to achieves fast training and real-time inference.

163, TITLE: Reconstructing Seen Images from Human Brain Activity Via Guided Stochastic Search
AUTHORS: Reese Kneeland ; Jordyn Ojeda ; Ghislain St-Yves ; Thomas Naselaris
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: Past reconstruction algorithms employed brute-force search through a massive library to select candidate images that, when passed through an encoding model, accurately predict brain activity. Here, we use conditional generative diffusion models to extend and improve this search-based strategy.

164, TITLE: Control Variate Sliced Wasserstein Estimators
AUTHORS: Khai Nguyen ; Nhat Ho

HIGHLIGHT: In particular, we propose using a lower bound and an upper bound of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two fitted Gaussians as two computationally efficient control variates.

169, TITLE: Polyp-SAM: Transfer SAM for Polyp Segmentation
AUTHORS: Yuheng Li ; Mingzhe Hu ; Xiaofeng Yang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: SAM demonstrates superior performance in several image benchmarks and therefore shows great potential for medical image segmentation. In this study, we propose Poly-SAM, a finetuned SAM model for polyp segmentation, and compare its performance to several state-of-the-art polyp segmentation models.

HIGHLIGHT: In this study, a public MRI imaging dataset contains 3064 TI-weighted images from 233 patients with three variants of brain tumor, viz. meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumor.

172, TITLE: Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using Bottleneck Transformers
AUTHORS: Arunima Jaiswal ; Ananya Sadana
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
