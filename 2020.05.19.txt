COMMENTS:       Accepted in IEEE ICIP 2018. IEEE Copyrights: Personal use of this material is permitted. Permission from IEEE must be obtained for all other uses
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a real-time semantic segmentation benchmarking framework with a decoupled design for feature extraction and decoding methods.

AUTHORS:        Magdalena Kaiser ; Rishiraj Saha Roy ; Gerhard Weikum
COMMENTS:       SIGIR 2020 Demonstrations
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we demonstrate CROWN (Conversational passage ranking by Reasoning Over Word Networks): an unsupervised yet effective system for conversational QA with passage responses, that supports several modes of context propagation over multiple turns.

109, TITLE:     Lane Detection in Low-light Conditions Using an Efficient Data Enhancement : Light Conditions Style Transfer
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01177
AUTHORS:        Tong Liu ; Zhaowei Chen ; Yi Yang ; Zehao Wu ; Haowei Li
COMMENTS:       Accepted by IV 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a style-transfer-based data enhancement method, which uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images in low-light conditions, that increases the environmental adaptability of the lane detector.

110, TITLE:     ProSelfLC: Progressive Self Label Correction for Target Revising in Label Noise
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03788
AUTHORS:        Xinshao Wang ; Yang Hua ; Elyor Kodirov ; Neil M. Robertson
COMMENTS:       Learning target revising, softer targets, entropy regularisation, EM algorithm. A target label distribution should define both the semantic class and similarity structure!
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we address robust deep learning under label noise (semi-supervised learning) from the perspective of target revising.

AUTHORS:        Christopher J. Cueva ; Peter Y. Wang ; Matthew Chin ; Xue-Xin Wei
COMMENTS:       International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      Recent work suggests goal-driven training of neural networks can be used to model neural activity in the brain.

AUTHORS:        Hanjie Chen ; Guangtao Zheng ; Yangfeng Ji
COMMENTS:       ACL 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we build hierarchical explanations by detecting feature interactions.

113, TITLE:     VeREFINE: Integrating Object Pose Verification with Physics-guided Iterative Refinement
http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05730
AUTHORS:        Dominik Bauer ; Timothy Patten ; Markus Vincze
COMMENTS:       Revised version
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we propose to integrate hypotheses verification with object pose refinement guided by physics simulation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05512
AUTHORS:        David McAllester
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose the foundation of set-theoretic dependent type theory and an objective defined in terms of the classification problem -- the problem of classifying concept instances up to isomorphism.

COMMENTS:       32 pages, 8 figures (7 + 1 supplemental), 8 tables (5 + 3 supplemental); Submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine
HIGHLIGHT:      In this study we investigated the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features extracted from MRI images and provide a workflow to identify robust features.
