AUTHORS: Xiandong Zou ; Xiangyu Zhao ; Pietro Liò ; Yiren Zhao
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, q-bio.BM, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these approaches suffer from two significant shortcomings: (1) the underlying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures used in these methods are often underexplored; and (2) these methods are often evaluated on only a limited number of metrics. To fill this gap, we investigate the expressiveness of GNNs under the context of the molecular graph generation task, by replacing the underlying GNNs of graph generative models with more expressive GNNs.

To isolate the key underlying factors, we focus on deep linear network models, and show that, surprisingly, such networks also display much of the behavior seen in biology and artificial networks, while being amenable to analytical treatment.

AUTHORS: Lucas Weber ; Jaap Jumelet ; Paul Michel ; Elia Bruni ; Dieuwke Hupkes
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: A deep dive into the (in)effectiveness of the curricula in some scenarios shows us why: when curricula are employed in combination with the popular Adam optimisation algorithm, they oftentimes learn to adapt to suboptimally chosen optimisation parameters for this algorithm. We present a number of different case studies with different common hand-crafted and automated CL approaches to illustrate this phenomenon, and we find that none of them outperforms optimisation with only Adam with well-chosen hyperparameters.

157, TITLE: Audio Generation with Multiple Conditional Diffusion Model
AUTHORS: ZHIFANG GUO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Text-based audio generation models have limitations as they cannot encompass all the information in audio, leading to restricted controllability when relying solely on text. To address this issue, we propose a novel model that enhances the controllability of existing pre-trained text-to-audio models by incorporating additional conditions including content (timestamp) and style (pitch contour and energy contour) as supplements to the text.

158, TITLE: Incremental Property Directed Reachability
AUTHORS: Max Blankestijn ; Alfons Laarman
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, cs.LO, B.8.1; I.1.2]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents an incremental version of PDR (IPDR), which enables the automatic verification of system instances of incremental complexity.

159, TITLE: Expressive Probabilistic Sampling in Recurrent Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Shirui Chen ; Linxin Preston Jiang ; Rajesh P. N. Rao ; Eric Shea-Brown
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: We call such circuits reservoir-sampler networks (RSNs). We propose an efficient training procedure based on denoising score matching that finds recurrent and output weights such that the RSN implements Langevin sampling.

AUTHORS: Yihan Wu ; Lana Vasung ; Camilo Calixto ; Ali Gholipour ; Davood Karimi
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: As a result, there is a lack of reliable normative baselines of structural connectivity metrics at this critical stage in brain development. In this study, we developed a computational framework, based on spatio-temporal averaging, for determining such baselines.

161, TITLE: Critical Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence As Digital Twin of Pathologist for Prostate Cancer Pathology
AUTHORS: OKYAZ EMINAGA et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.TO [q-bio.TO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We analyzed various factors influencing tumor-grade disagreement between vPatho and six human pathologists.

162, TITLE: Enhancing Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Through AI-enabled Calcium-omics
AUTHORS: AMMAR HOORI et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We employed sampling techniques to enhance model training.

163, TITLE: Recovering A Molecule's 3D Dynamics from Liquid-phase Electron Microscopy Movies
AUTHORS: ENZE YE et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose TEMPOR, a Temporal Electron MicroscoPy Object Reconstruction algorithm for liquid-phase EM that leverages an implicit neural representation (INR) and a dynamical variational auto-encoder (DVAE) to recover time series of molecular structures.

164, TITLE: Learning to Learn Financial Networks for Optimising Momentum Strategies
AUTHORS: Stefan Zohren ; Stephen Roberts ; Xiaowen Dong
CATEGORY: q-fin.PM [q-fin.PM, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-fin.TR, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, the traditional approach treats network construction and portfolio optimisation as separate tasks, potentially hindering optimal portfolio performance. To address these challenges, we propose L2GMOM, an end-to-end machine learning framework that simultaneously learns financial networks and optimises trading signals for network momentum strategies.

165, TITLE: Quantifying Degeneracy in Singular Models Via The Learning Coefficient
AUTHORS: Edmund Lau ; Daniel Murfet ; Susan Wei
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, 62F15, 68T07, 14B05]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we illustrate how a quantity known as the \emph{learning coefficient} introduced in singular learning theory quantifies precisely the degree of degeneracy in deep neural networks.

166, TITLE: Audio Difference Captioning Utilizing Similarity-Discrepancy Disentanglement
AUTHORS: Daiki Takeuchi ; Yasunori Ohishi ; Daisuke Niizumi ; Noboru Harada ; Kunio Kashino
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: We proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC) as a new extension task of audio captioning for describing the semantic differences between input pairs of similar but slightly different audio clips.

167, TITLE: SPPNet: A Single-Point Prompt Network for Nuclei Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: QING XU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, a single-point prompt network is proposed for nuclei image segmentation, called SPPNet.

168, TITLE: Anisotropic Hybrid Networks for Liver Tumor Segmentation with Uncertainty Quantification
AUTHORS: Benjamin Lambert ; Pauline Roca ; Florence Forbes ; Senan Doyle ; Michel Dojat
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we propose to compare two different pipelines based on anisotropic models to obtain the segmentation of the liver and tumors.

169, TITLE: Tumor-Centered Patching for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Mutyyba Asghar ; Ahmad Raza Shahid ; Akhtar Jamil ; Kiran Aftab ; Syed Ather Enam
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, F.2.2; I.2.7]
HIGHLIGHT: Traditional patch-based methods, though common, struggle to capture intricate tumor boundaries and often lead to redundant samples, compromising computational efficiency and feature quality. To tackle these issues, this research introduces an innovative approach centered on the tumor itself for patch-based image analysis.

170, TITLE: DISGAN: Wavelet-informed Discriminator Guides GAN to MRI Super-resolution with Noise Cleaning
AUTHORS: QI WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an innovative method that addresses both tasks simultaneously using a single deep learning model, eliminating the need for explicitly paired noisy and clean images during training.
