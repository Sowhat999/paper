54, TITLE: BUMP: A Benchmark of Unfaithful Minimal Pairs for Meta-Evaluation of Faithfulness Metrics
AUTHORS: LIANG MA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While existing benchmarks measure the correlation with human judgements of faithfulness on model-generated summaries, they are insufficient for diagnosing whether metrics are: 1) consistent, i.e., decrease as errors are introduced into a summary, 2) effective on human-written texts, and 3) sensitive to different error types (as summaries can contain multiple errors). To address these needs, we present a benchmark of unfaithful minimal pairs (BUMP), a dataset of 889 human-written, minimally different summary pairs, where a single error (from an ontology of 7 types) is introduced to a summary from the CNN/DailyMail dataset to produce an unfaithful summary.

96, TITLE: Cross-modal Attention Congruence Regularization for Vision-Language Relation Alignment
AUTHORS: Rohan Pandey ; Rulin Shao ; Paul Pu Liang ; Ruslan Salakhutdinov ; Louis-Philippe Morency
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We find that a critical component lacking from current vision-language models is relation-level alignment: the ability to match directional semantic relations in text (e.g., "mug in grass") with spatial relationships in the image (e.g., the position of the mug relative to the grass). To tackle this problem, we show that relation alignment can be enforced by encouraging the directed language attention from 'mug' to 'grass' (capturing the semantic relation 'in') to match the directed visual attention from the mug to the grass.

AUTHORS: Yu Wang ; Hongxia Jin

In this paper, we propose a hybrid rule-neural coreference resolution system based on actor-critic learning, such that it can achieve better coreference performance by leveraging the advantages from both the heuristic rules and a neural conference model.

100, TITLE: Debiasing NLP Models Without Demographic Information
AUTHORS: Hadas Orgad ; Yonatan Belinkov
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Although there are many methods suggested to mitigate biases, they require a preliminary information on the types of biases that should be mitigated (e.g., gender or racial bias) and the social groups associated with each data sample. In this work, we propose a debiasing method that operates without any prior knowledge of the demographics in the dataset, detecting biased examples based on an auxiliary model that predicts the main model's success and down-weights them during the training process.

To alleviate this, we introduce Hypernetworks for INstruction Tuning (HINT), which convert task instructions and examples using a pretrained text encoder into parameter-efficient modules inserted into an underlying model, eliminating the need to include instructions in the model input.

HIGHLIGHT: However, through empirical observation, we find that even the hard negatives from advanced methods are still too trivial for the teacher to distinguish, preventing the teacher from transferring abundant dark knowledge to the student through its soft label. To alleviate this issue, we propose ADAM, a knowledge distillation framework that can better transfer the dark knowledge held in the teacher with Adaptive Dark exAMples.

AUTHORS: Machel Reid ; Mikel Artetxe
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While prior work has established that the use of parallel data is conducive for cross-lingual learning, it is unclear if the improvements come from the data itself, or if it is the modeling of parallel interactions that matters. Exploring this, we examine the usage of unsupervised machine translation to generate synthetic parallel data, and compare it to supervised machine translation and gold parallel data.

Testing two state-of-the-art KBQA models (trained on original GrailQA as well as our GrailQAbility), we find that both models struggle to detect unanswerable questions, or sometimes detect them for the wrong reasons.
