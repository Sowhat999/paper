From this observation, we present Data Selection with Importance Resampling (DSIR), an efficient and scalable algorithm that estimates importance weights in a reduced feature space (e.g., n-gram features in our instantiation) and selects data with importance resampling according to these weights.

AUTHORS: Wenxiao Wang ; Soheil Feizi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this issue, we leverage timestamps denoting the birth dates of data, which are often available but neglected in the past. Benefiting from these timestamps, we propose a temporal threat model of data poisoning and derive two novel metrics, earliness and duration, which respectively measure how long an attack started in advance and how long an attack lasted.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.GT]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we attempt to bridge the two fields of finite-agent and infinite-agent games, by studying how the optimal policies of agents evolve with the number of agents (population size) in mean-field games, an agent-centric perspective in contrast to the existing works focusing typically on the convergence of the empirical distribution of the population.

To help software engineers make responsible decisions when adopting these unlearning methods, we present the first study on machine unlearning methods to reveal their fairness implications.

110, TITLE: VertXNet: An Ensemble Method for Vertebrae Segmentation and Identification of Spinal X-Ray
AUTHORS: YAO CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, obtaining annotation of vertebrae from those images is usually carried out manually due to its complexity (i.e. small structures with varying shape), making it a costly and tedious process. To accelerate this process, we proposed an ensemble pipeline, VertXNet, that combines two state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation models (respectively U-Net and Mask R-CNN) to automatically segment and label vertebrae in X-ray spinal images.
