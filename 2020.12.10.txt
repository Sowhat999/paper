88, TITLE: Improving Gradient Flow With Unrolled Highway Expectation Maximization
AUTHORS: Chonghyuk Song ; Eunseok Kim ; Inwook Shim
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NE]

93, TITLE: SongMASS: Automatic Song Writing With Pre-training And Alignment Constraint
AUTHORS: ZHONGHAO SHENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose SongMASS to address the above challenges, which leverages masked sequence to sequence (MASS) pre-training and attention based alignment modeling for lyric-to-melody and melody-to-lyric generation.

94, TITLE: Discovering Clinically Meaningful Shape Features For The Analysis Of Tumor Pathology Images
AUTHORS: Esteban Fernández Morales ; Cong Zhang ; Guanghua Xiao ; Chul Moon ; Qiwei Li
CATEGORY: stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.CV]

95, TITLE: Conjugate Mixture Models For Clustering Multimodal Data
AUTHORS: Vasil Khalidov ; Florence Forbes ; Radu Horaud
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SD, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we show that multimodal clustering can be addressed within a novel framework, namely conjugate mixture models.

96, TITLE: Robustness Of Model Predictions Under Extension
AUTHORS: Tineke Blom ; Joris M. Mooij
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we consider conditions under which qualitative model predictions are preserved when two models are combined.

97, TITLE: Automated Scoring Of Nuclear Pleomorphism Spectrum With Pathologist-level Performance In Breast Cancer
AUTHORS: CANER MERCAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We also motivate an additional approach in which we discuss the additional benefit of normal epithelium as baseline, following the routine clinical practice where pathologists are trained to score nuclear pleomorphism in tumor, having the normal breast epithelium as baseline.

98, TITLE: Conditional Generation Of Medical Images Via Disentangled Adversarial Inference
AUTHORS: Mohammad Havaei ; Ximeng Mao ; Yiping Wang ; Qicheng Lao
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we propose a methodology to learn from the image itself, disentangled representations of style and content, and use this information to impose control over the generation process.

99, TITLE: 2-Step Sparse-View CT Reconstruction With A Domain-Specific Perceptual Network
AUTHORS: HAOYU WEI et. al.

101, TITLE: AIDE: Annotation-efficient Deep Learning For Automatic Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: CHENG LI et. al.
