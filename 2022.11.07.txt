AUTHORS: YIN ZHU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]

89, TITLE: SPEAKER VGG CCT: Cross-corpus Speech Emotion Recognition with Speaker Embedding and Vision Transformers
AUTHORS: A. Arezzo ; S. Berretti
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In recent years, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has been investigated mainly transforming the speech signal into spectrograms that are then classified using Convolutional Neural Networks pretrained on generic images and fine tuned with spectrograms. In this paper, we start from the general idea above and develop a new learning solution for SER, which is based on Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCTs) combined with a speaker embedding.

90, TITLE: Spatial-Temporal Convolutional Attention for Mapping Functional Brain Networks
AUTHORS: Yiheng Liu ; Enjie Ge ; Ning Qiang ; Tianming Liu ; Bao Ge
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Due to the widespread local correlations in the volumes, FBNs can be generated directly in the spatial domain in a self-supervised manner by using spatial-wise attention (SA), and the resulting FBNs has a higher spatial similarity with templates compared to the classical method. Therefore, we proposed a novel Spatial-Temporal Convolutional Attention (STCA) model to discover the dynamic FBNs by using the sliding windows.

96, TITLE: High-Resolution Boundary Detection for Medical Image Segmentation with Piece-Wise Two-Sample T-Test Augmented Loss
AUTHORS: YUCONG LIN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We developed a novel loss function that is tailored to reflect the boundary information to enhance the boundary detection. As the contrast between segmentation and background regions along the classification boundary naturally induces heterogeneity over the pixels, we propose the piece-wise two-sample t-test augmented (PTA) loss that is infused with the statistical test for such heterogeneity.

97, TITLE: Fighting The Scanner Effect in Brain MRI Segmentation with A Progressive Level-of-detail Network Trained on Multi-site Data
AUTHORS: Michele Svanera ; Mattia Savardi ; Alberto Signoroni ; Sergio Benini ; Lars Muckli
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The performance degradation experienced on external data (i.e., unseen volumes from unseen sites) is due to the inter-site variabilities in intensity distributions induced by different MR scanner models, acquisition parameters, and unique artefacts. To mitigate this site-dependency, often referred to as the scanner effect, we propose LOD-Brain, a 3D convolutional neural network with progressive levels-of-detail (LOD) able to segment brain data from any site.
