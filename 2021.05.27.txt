CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: The aim of this work is to understand and optimise learned models in video processing applications so systems that incorporate them can be used in a more trustworthy manner.

90, TITLE: Permutation Invariance and Uncertainty in Multitemporal Image Super-resolution
AUTHORS: Diego Valsesia ; Enrico Magli
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show how building a model that is fully invariant to temporal permutation significantly improves performance and data efficiency.

91, TITLE: CBANet: Towards Complexity and Bitrate Adaptive Deep Image Compression Using A Single Network
AUTHORS: Jinyang Guo ; Dong Xu ; Guo Lu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a new deep image compression framework called Complexity and Bitrate Adaptive Network (CBANet), which aims to learn one single network to support variable bitrate coding under different computational complexity constraints.

92, TITLE: Weighing Features of Lung and Heart Regions for Thoracic Disease Classification
AUTHORS: JIANSHENG FANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Inspired by this, we propose a novel deep learning framework to explore discriminative information from lung and heart regions.
