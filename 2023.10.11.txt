2, TITLE: We Are What We Repeatedly Do: Inducing and Deploying Habitual Schemas in Persona-based Responses
AUTHORS: Benjamin Kane ; Lenhart Schubert

HIGHLIGHT: However, in realistic human conversations, personas are often revealed through story-like narratives that involve rich habitual knowledge -- knowledge about kinds of events that an agent often participates in (e.g., work activities, hobbies, sporting activities, favorite entertainments, etc.), including typical goals, sub-events, preconditions, and postconditions of those events. We capture such habitual knowledge using an explicit schema representation, and propose an approach to dialogue generation that retrieves relevant schemas to condition a large language model to generate persona-based responses.
