7, TITLE: Beware The Rationalization Trap! When Language Model Explainability Diverges from Our Mental Models of Language
AUTHORS: Rita Sevastjanova ; Mennatallah El-Assady
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Thus, to assess the success of language model explainability, we need to consider the impact of its divergence from a user's mental model of language. In this position paper, we argue that in order to avoid harmful rationalization and achieve truthful understanding of language models, explanation processes must satisfy three main conditions: (1) explanations have to truthfully represent the model behavior, i.e., have a high fidelity; (2) explanations must be complete, as missing information distorts the truth; and (3) explanations have to take the user's mental model into account, progressively verifying a person's knowledge and adapting their understanding.

AUTHORS: NEIL MALLINAR et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Aiming to explain this, a body of recent work has studied $\textit{benign overfitting}$, a phenomenon where some interpolating methods approach Bayes optimality, even in the presence of noise. In this work we argue that while benign overfitting has been instructive and fruitful to study, many real interpolating methods like neural networks $\textit{do not fit benignly}$: modest noise in the training set causes nonzero (but non-infinite) excess risk at test time, implying these models are neither benign nor catastrophic but rather fall in an intermediate regime.
