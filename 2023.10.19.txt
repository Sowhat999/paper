22, TITLE: Learning from Rich Semantics and Coarse Locations for Long-tailed Object Detection
AUTHORS: LINGCHEN MENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: One popular strategy is to explore extra data with image-level labels, yet it produces limited results due to (1) semantic ambiguity -- an image-level label only captures a salient part of the image, ignoring the remaining rich semantics within the image; and (2) location sensitivity -- the label highly depends on the locations and crops of the original image, which may change after data transformations like random cropping. To remedy this, we propose RichSem, a simple but effective method, which is robust to learn rich semantics from coarse locations without the need of accurate bounding boxes.

In this work, we anticipate an innovative MRI system and its four generations that integrate emerging distributed cloud computing, 6G bandwidth, edge computing, federated learning, and blockchain technology.

166, TITLE: Learning Lens Blur Fields
AUTHORS: ESTHER Y. H. LIN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Optical blur is an inherent property of any lens system and is challenging to model in modern cameras because of their complex optical elements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a high-dimensional neural representation of blur$-$$\textit{the lens blur field}$$-$and a practical method for acquiring it.

167, TITLE: Multi-modal Medical Neurological Image Fusion Using Wavelet Pooled Edge Preserving Autoencoder
AUTHORS: Manisha Das ; Deep Gupta ; Petia Radeva ; Ashwini M Bakde
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: It causes the blurring or loss of important diagnostic information and edge details available in the source images and dilutes the efficacy of the feature extraction process. Therefore, this paper presents an end-to-end unsupervised fusion model for multimodal medical images based on an edge-preserving dense autoencoder network.
