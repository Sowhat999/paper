COMMENTS:       Accepted for publication at Multimodal Learning for Clinical Decision Support Workshop at MICCAI 2020 (edit: corrected typos and model name in Fig. 3, added missing circles in Table 1)
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a simultaneous co-segmentation method, which enables multimodal feature learning through modality-specific encoder and decoder branches, and the use of resource-effcient densely connected convolutional layers.
