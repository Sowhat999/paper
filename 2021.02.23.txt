AUTHORS: Sebastian Fix ; Thomas Probst ; Oliver Ruggli ; Thomas Hanne ; Patrik Christen
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In the present paper we want to employ combinatorial evolution in software development.

178, TITLE: CheckSoft : A Scalable Event-Driven Software Architecture for Keeping Track of People and Things in People-Centric Spaces
AUTHORS: Rohan Sarkar ; Avinash C. Kak
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.DC, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present CheckSoft, a scalable event-driven software architecture for keeping track of people-object interactions in people-centric applications such as airport checkpoint security areas, automated retail stores, smart libraries, and so on.

179, TITLE: An Algorithm to Determine Regular Singular Mahler Systems
AUTHORS: Colin Faverjon ; Marina Poulet
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, math.NT]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper is devoted to the study of the analytic properties of Mahler systems at 0.

180, TITLE: Root Radii and Subdivision for Polynomial Root-Finding
AUTHORS: Rémi Imbach ; Victor Y. Pan
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC]
HIGHLIGHT: We present an implementable version of this algorithm and by using the computed sets of annuli improve in practice subdivision algorithms for CRC and RRI while supporting near optimal bit complexity.

181, TITLE: "Am I A Good Therapist?" Automated Evaluation Of Psychotherapy Skills Using Speech And Language Technologies
AUTHORS: NIKOLAOS FLEMOTOMOS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: We describe our platform and its performance, using a dataset of more than 5,000 recordings drawn from its deployment in a real-world clinical setting used to assist training of new therapists.

182, TITLE: The Use of Voice Source Features for Sung Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: Gerardo Roa Dabike ; Jon Barker
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we ask whether vocal source features (pitch, shimmer, jitter, etc) can improve the performance of automatic sung speech recognition, arguing that conclusions previously drawn from spoken speech studies may not be valid in the sung speech domain.

183, TITLE: Comparative Fault Location Estimation By Using Image Processing in Mixed Transmission Lines
AUTHORS: Serkan Budak ; Bahadir Akbal
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, 154 kV overhead transmission line and underground cable line are examined as the mixed transmission line for the distance protection relays.

184, TITLE: Classification of COVID-19 Via Homology of CT-SCAN
AUTHORS: Sohail Iqbal ; H. Fareed Ahmed ; Talha Qaiser ; Muhammad Imran Qureshi ; Nasir Rajpoot
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, math.AT]
HIGHLIGHT: In this article, We propose a novel approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CT-scan images.

185, TITLE: Tchebichef Transform Domain-based Deep Learning Architecture for Image Super-resolution
AUTHORS: Ahlad Kumar ; Harsh Vardhan Singh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a deep learning based image super-resolution architecture in Tchebichef transform domain.

186, TITLE: RCoNet: Deformable Mutual Information Maximization and High-order Uncertainty-aware Learning for Robust COVID-19 Detection
AUTHORS: Shunjie Dong ; Qianqian Yang ; Yu Fu ; Mei Tian ; Cheng Zhuo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To alleviate these concerns, we propose a novel deep network named {\em RCoNet$^k_s$} for robust COVID-19 detection which employs {\em Deformable Mutual Information Maximization} (DeIM), {\em Mixed High-order Moment Feature} (MHMF) and {\em Multi-expert Uncertainty-aware Learning} (MUL).
