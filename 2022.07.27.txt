To alleviate these issues, we propose to use abstraction.

To solve the above problems, we propose the idea of feature repair for the first time and introduce the blind watermark technique to repair the poisoned features lost during the generation of poisoned data.

AUTHORS: Kevin Kappelmann ; Jonas Rädle ; Lukas Stevens
CATEGORY: cs.CY [cs.CY, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires institutions to radically replace the traditional way of on-site teaching, moving interaction from physical to virtual space. We report on our strategies and experience tackling these issues as part of a Haskell-based functional programming and verification course, accommodating over 2000 students in the course of two semesters.

86, TITLE: Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance
AUTHORS: Jonathan Ho ; Tim Salimans

We show that guidance can be indeed performed by a pure generative model without such a classifier: in what we call classifier-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score estimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that obtained using classifier guidance.

89, TITLE: Reconciling Security and Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning
AUTHORS: KARTHIK PRASAD et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC]
HIGHLIGHT: However, communication efficiency remains a major bottleneck when scaling federated learning to production environments, particularly due to bandwidth constraints during uplink communication. In this paper, we formalize and address the problem of compressing client-to-server model updates under the Secure Aggregation primitive, a core component of Federated Learning pipelines that allows the server to aggregate the client updates without accessing them individually.

90, TITLE: Optimizing Empty Container Repositioning and Fleet Deployment Via Configurable Semi-POMDPs
AUTHORS: Riccardo Poiani ; Ciprian Stirbu ; Alberto Maria Metelli ; Marcello Restelli
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.MA]

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Configurable Semi-POMDPs, to model this type of problems.
