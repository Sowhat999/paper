AUTHORS: DONYA KHALEDYAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we present a novel segmentation model known as Wavelet_Attention_UNet (WATUNet).

318, TITLE: Shape-Sensitive Loss for Catheter and Guidewire Segmentation
AUTHORS: CHAYUN KONGTONGVATTANA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce a shape-sensitive loss function for catheter and guidewire segmentation and utilize it in a vision transformer network to establish a new state-of-the-art result on a large-scale X-ray images dataset.

319, TITLE: 3D Guidewire Shape Reconstruction from Monoplane Fluoroscopic Images
AUTHORS: Tudor Jianu ; Baoru Huang ; Pierre Berthet-Rayne ; Sebastiano Fichera ; Anh Nguyen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct the 3D guidewire by utilizing CathSim, a state-of-the-art endovascular simulator, and a 3D Fluoroscopy Guidewire Reconstruction Network (3D-FGRN).

320, TITLE: Deep Coherence Learning: An Unsupervised Deep Beamformer for High Quality Single Plane Wave Imaging in Medical Ultrasound
AUTHORS: Hyunwoo Cho ; Seongjun Park ; Jinbum Kang ; Yangmo Yoo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: However, due to the lack of appropriate ground truth images, DL-based PWI still remains challenging for performance improvements. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new unsupervised learning approach, i.e., deep coherence learning (DCL)-based DL beamformer (DL-DCL), for high-quality single PWI.

321, TITLE: Enhancing Radiology Diagnosis Through Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision in Healthcare
AUTHORS: Keshav Kumar K. ; Dr N V S L Narasimham
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The transformative power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in radiology diagnostics is examined in this study, with a focus on interpretability, effectiveness, and ethical issues.
