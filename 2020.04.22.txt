28, TITLE:      Learn How to Cook a New Recipe in a New House: Using Map Familiarization, Curriculum Learning, and Bandit Feedback to Learn Families of Text-Based Adventure Games
http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04777
AUTHORS:        Xusen Yin ; Jonathan May
HIGHLIGHT:      We consider the task of learning to play families of text-based computer adventure games, i.e., fully textual environments with a common theme (e.g. cooking) and goal (e.g. prepare a meal from a recipe) but with different specifics; new instances of such games are relatively straightforward for humans to master after a brief exposure to the genre but have been curiously difficult for computer agents to learn.

29, TITLE:      Long-tail Visual Relationship Recognition with a Visiolinguistic Hubless Loss
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00436
AUTHORS:        Sherif Abdelkarim ; Panos Achlioptas ; Jiaji Huang ; Boyang Li ; Kenneth Church ; Mohamed Elhoseiny
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose to study a novel task concerning the generalization of visual relationships that are on the distribution's tail, i.e. we investigate how to help AI systems to better recognize rare relationships like <S:dog, P:riding, O:horse>, where the subject S, predicate P, and/or the object O come from the tail of the corresponding distributions. To achieve this goal, we first introduce two large-scale visual-relationship detection benchmarks built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets.
