http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12841
AUTHORS:        Simone Fontana ; Daniele Cattaneo ; Augusto Luis Ballardini ; Matteo Vaghi ; Domenico Giorgio Sorrenti
HIGHLIGHT:      This work aims at encouraging authors to use a public and shared benchmark, instead than data collected ad-hoc, to ensure objectivity and repeatability, two fundamental characteristics in any scientific field. For these reasons, we developed a benchmark, for localization and mapping applications, using multiple publicly available datasets. Along with the data, we provide a broad set of registration problems, chosen to cover different types of initial misalignment, various degrees of overlap, and different kinds of registration problems.
