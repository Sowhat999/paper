AUTHORS: Jiannan Xiang ; Zhengzhong Liu ; Yucheng Zhou ; Eric P. Xing ; Zhiting Hu
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, real-world data-to-text problems often suffer from various data-scarce issues: one may have access to only a handful of or no training examples, and/or have to rely on examples in a different domain or schema. To fill this gap, we propose Any-Shot Data-to-Text (ASDOT), a new approach flexibly applicable to diverse settings by making efficient use of any given (or no) examples.

AUTHORS: Zheheng Luo ; Qianqian Xie ; Sophia Ananiadou
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing biomedical document summarization systems have paid little attention to readability control, leaving users with summaries that are incompatible with their levels of expertise. In recognition of this urgent demand, we introduce a new task of readability controllable summarization for biomedical documents, which aims to recognise users' readability demands and generate summaries that better suit their needs: technical summaries for experts and plain language summaries (PLS) for laymen.

38, TITLE: CHARD: Clinical Health-Aware Reasoning Across Dimensions for Text Generation Models

40, TITLE: SparseAdapter: An Easy Approach for Improving The Parameter-Efficiency of Adapters
AUTHORS: Shwai He ; Liang Ding ; Daize Dong ; Miao Zhang ; Dacheng Tao
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Although computationally efficient, the recent Adapters often increase parameters (e.g. bottleneck dimension) for matching the performance of full model fine-tuning, which we argue goes against their original intention. In this work, we re-examine the parameter-efficiency of Adapters through the lens of network pruning (we name such plug-in concept as \texttt{SparseAdapter}) and find that SparseAdapter can achieve comparable or better performance than standard Adapters when the sparse ratio reaches up to 80\%.

41, TITLE: Controllable Dialogue Simulation with In-Context Learning

HIGHLIGHT: Identifying near duplicates within large, noisy text corpora has a myriad of applications that range from de-duplicating training datasets, reducing privacy risk, and evaluating test set leakage, to identifying reproduced news articles and literature within large corpora.

46, TITLE: Cross-Align: Modeling Deep Cross-lingual Interactions for Word Alignment
AUTHORS: SIYU LAI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, we find that the existing approaches capture few interactions between the input sentence pairs, which degrades the word alignment quality severely, especially for the ambiguous words in the monolingual context. To remedy this problem, we propose Cross-Align to model deep interactions between the input sentence pairs, in which the source and target sentences are encoded separately with the shared self-attention modules in the shallow layers, while cross-lingual interactions are explicitly constructed by the cross-attention modules in the upper layers.

47, TITLE: HEGEL: Hypergraph Transformer for Long Document Summarization

AUTHORS: Francesco Cazzaro ; Davide Locatelli ; Ariadna Quattoni ; Xavier Carreras
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This limitation led to a resurgence of methods that model alignments between sentences and their corresponding meaning representations, either implicitly through latent variables or explicitly by taking advantage of alignment annotations. We take the second direction and propose TPol, a two-step approach that first translates input sentences monotonically and then reorders them to obtain the correct output.

AUTHORS: Siddhartha Brahma ; Polina Zablotskaia ; David Mimno
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We find that on three common finetuning tasks even using attention that is at least 78% sparse can have little effect on performance if applied at later transformer layers, but that applying sparsity throughout the network reduces performance significantly.

56, TITLE: Knowledge Distillation Transfer Sets and Their Impact on Downstream NLU Tasks
AUTHORS: CHARITH PERIS et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, the generic corpora used to pretrain the teacher and the corpora associated with the downstream target domain are often significantly different, which raises a natural question: should the student be distilled over the generic corpora, so as to learn from high-quality teacher predictions, or over the downstream task corpora to align with finetuning? Our study investigates this trade-off using Domain Classification (DC) and Intent Classification/Named Entity Recognition (ICNER) as downstream tasks.

AUTHORS: YI CHENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In comparison, multi-turn ES conversation systems can provide ES more effectively, but face several new technical challenges, including: (1) how to adopt appropriate support strategies to achieve the long-term dialogue goal of comforting the user's emotion; (2) how to dynamically model the user's state. In this paper, we propose a novel system MultiESC to address these issues.

65, TITLE: Understanding and Improving Zero-shot Multi-hop Reasoning in Generative Question Answering
AUTHORS: Zhengbao Jiang ; Jun Araki ; Haibo Ding ; Graham Neubig
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Generative question answering (QA) models generate answers to questions either solely based on the parameters of the model (the closed-book setting) or additionally retrieving relevant evidence (the open-book setting). Generative QA models can answer some relatively complex questions, but the mechanism through which they do so is still poorly understood.

66, TITLE: Revealing Patient-Reported Experiences in Healthcare from Social Media Using The DAPMAV Framework
AUTHORS: Curtis Murray ; Lewis Mitchell ; Jonathan Tuke ; Mark Mackay
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in contrast with the vast presence of patient-experience data on social media and the potential benefits the data offers, it attracts comparatively little research attention due to the technical proficiency required for text analysis. In this paper, we introduce the Design-Acquire-Process-Model-Analyse-Visualise (DAPMAV) framework to equip non-technical domain experts with a structured approach that will enable them to capture patient-reported experiences from social media data.

67, TITLE: Label-Driven Denoising Framework for Multi-Label Few-Shot Aspect Category Detection
AUTHORS: Fei Zhao ; Yuchen Shen ; Zhen Wu ; Xinyu Dai
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, they still suffer from serious noise problems: (1) due to lack of sufficient supervised data, the previous methods easily catch noisy words irrelevant to the current aspect category, which largely affects the quality of the generated prototype; (2) the semantically-close aspect categories usually generate similar prototypes, which are mutually noisy and confuse the classifier seriously. In this paper, we resort to the label information of each aspect to tackle the above problems, along with proposing a novel Label-Driven Denoising Framework (LDF).

68, TITLE: Parameter-Efficient Tuning with Special Token Adaptation

88, TITLE: Learning Robust Representations for Continual Relation Extraction Via Adversarial Class Augmentation
AUTHORS: PEIYI WANG et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Most previous work attributes catastrophic forgetting to the corruption of the learned representations as new relations come, with an implicit assumption that the CRE models have adequately learned the old relations. In this paper, through empirical studies we argue that this assumption may not hold, and an important reason for catastrophic forgetting is that the learned representations do not have good robustness against the appearance of analogous relations in the subsequent learning process.

105, TITLE: Contextual Modeling for 3D Dense Captioning on Point Clouds
AUTHORS: Yufeng Zhong ; Long Xu ; Jiebo Luo ; Lin Ma

AUTHORS: AISHA CHANDIO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: There are still two problems in SDD causing some inaccurate results: (1) In the process of feature extraction, with the layer-by-layer acquisition of semantic information, local information is gradually lost, resulting into less representative feature maps; (2) During the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm due to inconsistency in classification and regression tasks, the classification confidence and predicted detection position cannot accurately indicate the position of the prediction boxes. Methods: In order to address these aforementioned issues, we propose a new architecture, a modified version of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), named Precise Single Stage Detector (PSSD).

Towards this end, we propose a novel method that crafts adversarial examples by manipulating the distribution of the image.

We propose to rectify the feature into its typical set and calculate the OOD score with the typical features to achieve reliable uncertainty estimation.
