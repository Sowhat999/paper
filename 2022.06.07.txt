We find that these models robustly encode character-level information and, in general, larger models perform better at the task.

AUTHORS: Shuhuai Ren ; Lei Li ; Xuancheng Ren ; Guangxiang Zhao ; Xu Sun
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Further analysis reveals that the over-estimation of openness is not because CLIP-like models fail to capture the general similarity of image and text features of novel visual concepts, but because of the confusion among competing text features, that is, they are not stable with respect to the vocabulary. In light of this, we propose to improve the openness of CLIP from the perspective of feature space by enforcing the distinguishability of text features.
