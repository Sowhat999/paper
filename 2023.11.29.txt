162, TITLE: MultiModal-Learning for Predicting Molecular Properties: A Framework Based on Image and Graph Structures
AUTHORS: Zhuoyuan Wang ; Jiacong Mi ; Shan Lu ; Jieyue He
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, physics.chem-ph, q-bio.BM]
HIGHLIGHT: However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures.
