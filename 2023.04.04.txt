AUTHORS: MOHAMED AMINE CHATTI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.IR]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the acknowledgment that the perception of explanations may vary considerably between end-users, explainable recommender systems (RS) have traditionally followed a one-size-fits-all model, whereby the same explanation level of detail is provided to each user, without taking into consideration individual user's context, i.e., goals and personal characteristics. To fill this research gap, we aim in this paper at a shift from a one-size-fits-all to a personalized approach to explainable recommendation by giving users agency in deciding which explanation they would like to see.

40, TITLE: When Crowd Meets Persona: Creating A Large-Scale Open-Domain Persona Dialogue Corpus
AUTHORS: WON IK CHO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Open-domain conversations involve two or more crowdworkers freely conversing about any topic, and collecting such data is particularly difficult for two reasons: 1) the dataset should be ``crafted" rather than ``obtained" due to privacy concerns, and 2) paid creation of such dialogues may differ from how crowdworkers behave in real-world settings. In this study, we tackle these issues when creating a large-scale open-domain persona dialogue corpus, where persona implies that the conversation is performed by several actors with a fixed persona and user-side workers from an unspecified crowd.

AUTHORS: YOUJIA ZHANG et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Recovering the physical attributes of an object's appearance from its images captured under an unknown illumination is challenging yet essential for photo-realistic rendering. Recent approaches adopt the emerging implicit scene representations and have shown impressive results.However, they unanimously adopt a surface-based representation,and hence can not well handle scenes with very complex geometry, translucent object and etc.In this paper, we propose to conduct inverse volume rendering, in contrast to surface-based, by representing a scene using microflake volume, which assumes the space is filled with infinite small flakes and light reflects or scatters at each spatial location according to microflake distributions.
