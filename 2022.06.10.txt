AUTHORS: ZHENDA XIE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, one method that has recently become popular, namely masked image modeling (MIM), is suspected to be unable to benefit from larger data. In this work, we break this misconception through extensive experiments, with data scales ranging from 10\% of ImageNet-1K to full ImageNet-22K, model sizes ranging from 49 million to 1 billion, and training lengths ranging from 125K iterations to 500K iterations.

HIGHLIGHT: These encoded biases can influence the decision of a recommendation system (RS) towards further separation of the contents provided to various demographic subgroups, and raise privacy concerns regarding the disclosure of users' protected attributes. In this work, we investigate the possibility and challenges of removing specific protected information of users from the learned interaction representations of a RS algorithm, while maintaining its effectiveness.

90, TITLE: Value Memory Graph: A Graph-Structured World Model for Offline Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Deyao Zhu ; Li Erran Li ; Mohamed Elhoseiny
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent works in graph-structured world models improve the long-horizon reasoning ability via building a graph to represent the environment, but they are designed in a goal-conditioned setting and cannot guide the agent to maximize episode returns in a traditional reinforcement learning setting without externally given target states. To overcome this limitation, we design a graph-structured world model in offline reinforcement learning by building a directed-graph-based Markov decision process (MDP) with rewards allocated to each directed edge as an abstraction of the original continuous environment.

91, TITLE: Pseudo-Poincaré: A Unification Framework for Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks

92, TITLE: Trajectory-dependent Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks Via Fractional Brownian Motion
AUTHORS: Chengli Tan ; Jiangshe Zhang ; Junmin Liu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, recent studies suggest these bounds might be problematic as they increase with the training set size, which is contrary to empirical evidence. In this study, we argue that the hypothesis set SGD explores is trajectory-dependent and thus may provide a tighter bound over its Rademacher complexity.

93, TITLE: Graph Attention Multi-Layer Perceptron
AUTHORS: WENTAO ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although some scalable GNNs are proposed for large-scale graphs, they adopt a fixed $K$-hop neighborhood for each node, thus facing the over-smoothing issue when adopting large propagation depths for nodes within sparse regions. To tackle the above issue, we propose a new GNN architecture -- Graph Attention Multi-Layer Perceptron (GAMLP), which can capture the underlying correlations between different scales of graph knowledge.

94, TITLE: A Relational Intervention Approach for Unsupervised Dynamics Generalization in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Jixian Guo ; Mingming Gong ; Dacheng Tao
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: As a result, the learned dynamics prediction function will deviate from the true one, which undermines the generalization ability. To tackle this problem, we introduce an interventional prediction module to estimate the probability of two estimated $\hat{z}_i, \hat{z}_j$ belonging to the same environment.

95, TITLE: GSmooth: Certified Robustness Against Semantic Transformations Via Generalized Randomized Smoothing
AUTHORS: ZHONGKAI HAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods are insufficient or unable to provably defend against semantic transformations, especially those without closed-form expressions (such as defocus blur and pixelate), which are more common in practice and often unrestricted. To fill up this gap, we propose generalized randomized smoothing (GSmooth), a unified theoretical framework for certifying robustness against general semantic transformations via a novel dimension augmentation strategy.

96, TITLE: ExpressivE: A Spatio-Functional Embedding For Knowledge Graph Completion
AUTHORS: Aleksandar Pavlovi? ; Emanuel Sallinger
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Embedding models have yielded promising results for KGC, yet any current KGC embedding model is incapable of: (1) fully capturing vital inference patterns (e.g., composition), (2) capturing prominent logical rules jointly (e.g., hierarchy and composition), and (3) providing an intuitive interpretation of captured patterns. In this work, we propose ExpressivE, a fully expressive spatio-functional embedding model that solves all these challenges simultaneously.

97, TITLE: Adversarial Noises Are Linearly Separable for (Nearly) Random Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Huishuai Zhang ; Da Yu ; Yiping Lu ; Di He
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Adversarial examples, which are usually generated for specific inputs with a specific model, are ubiquitous for neural networks. In this paper we unveil a surprising property of adversarial noises when they are put together, i.e., adversarial noises crafted by one-step gradient methods are linearly separable if equipped with the corresponding labels.

99, TITLE: Neo-GNNs: Neighborhood Overlap-aware Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction
AUTHORS: Seongjun Yun ; Seoyoon Kim ; Junhyun Lee ; Jaewoo Kang ; Hyunwoo J. Kim
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, since GNNs heavily rely on smoothed node features rather than graph structure, they often show poor performance than simple heuristic methods in link prediction where the structural information, e.g., overlapped neighborhoods, degrees, and shortest paths, is crucial. To address this limitation, we propose Neighborhood Overlap-aware Graph Neural Networks (Neo-GNNs) that learn useful structural features from an adjacency matrix and estimate overlapped neighborhoods for link prediction.

HIGHLIGHT: Such a modular decomposition of knowledge enables adaptation to distributions shifts by only updating a subset of parameters. In this work, we systematically study the generalization and adaption performance of such modular neural causal models by comparing it to monolithic models and structured models where the set of predictors is not constrained to causal parents.

103, TITLE: Xplique: A Deep Learning Explainability Toolbox
AUTHORS: THOMAS FEL et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The key challenge for explainability methods is to help assisting researchers in opening up these black boxes, by revealing the strategy that led to a given decision, by characterizing their internal states or by studying the underlying data representation. To address this challenge, we have developed Xplique: a software library for explainability which includes representative explainability methods as well as associated evaluation metrics.

104, TITLE: Towards Safe Reinforcement Learning Via Constraining Conditional Value-at-Risk
AUTHORS: CHENGYANG YING et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To address these issues, we first theoretically prove that the performance degradation under transition disturbance and observation disturbance depends on a novel metric of Value Function Range (VFR), which corresponds to the gap in the value function between the best state and the worst state. Based on the analysis, we adopt conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as an assessment of risk and propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm of CVaR-Proximal-Policy-Optimization (CPPO) which formalizes the risk-sensitive constrained optimization problem by keeping its CVaR under a given threshold.

AUTHORS: Marcin Michal Komarnicki ; Michal Witold Przewozniczek ; Halina Kwasnicka

112, TITLE: Temporal Logic Imitation: Learning Plan-Satisficing Motion Policies from Demonstrations
AUTHORS: Yanwei Wang ; Nadia Figueroa ; Shen Li ; Ankit Shah ; Julie Shah
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.FL, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: Learning from demonstration (LfD) methods have shown promise for solving multi-step tasks; however, these approaches do not guarantee successful reproduction of the task given disturbances. In this work, we identify the roots of such a challenge as the failure of the learned continuous policy to satisfy the discrete plan implicit in the demonstration.

119, TITLE: A No-Reference Deep Learning Quality Assessment Method for Super-resolution Images Based on Frequency Maps
AUTHORS: ZICHENG ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Note that most existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods were developed for synthetically distorted images, which may not work for SRIs since their distortions are more diverse and complicated. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a no-reference deep-learning image quality assessment method based on frequency maps because the artifacts caused by SISR algorithms are quite sensitive to frequency information.

120, TITLE: Joint Modeling of Image and Label Statistics for Enhancing Model Generalizability of Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Shangqi Gao ; Hangqi Zhou ; Yibo Gao ; Xiahai Zhuang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although supervised deep-learning has achieved promising performance in medical image segmentation, many methods cannot generalize well on unseen data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning-based Bayesian framework, which jointly models image and label statistics, utilizing the domain-irrelevant contour of a medical image for segmentation.
