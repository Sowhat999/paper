HIGHLIGHT: For image classification, the most popular data augmentation techniques range from simple photometric and geometrical transformations, to more complex methods that use visual saliency to craft new training examples. As augmentation methods get more complex, their ability to increase the test accuracy improves, yet, such methods become cumbersome, inefficient and lead to poor out-of-domain generalization, as we show in this paper.

AUTHORS: Marco Comunità ; Christian J. Steinmetz ; Huy Phan ; Joshua D. Reiss
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: While recurrent and convolutional architectures can theoretically be extended to capture behaviour at longer time scales, we show that simply scaling the width, depth, or dilation factor of existing architectures does not result in satisfactory performance when modelling audio effects such as fuzz and dynamic range compression. To address this, we propose the integration of time-varying feature-wise linear modulation into existing temporal convolutional backbones, an approach that enables learnable adaptation of the intermediate activations.
