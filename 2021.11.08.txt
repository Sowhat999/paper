92, TITLE: Learning of Frequency-Time Attention Mechanism for Automatic Modulation Recognition
AUTHORS: Shangao Lin ; Yuan Zeng ; Yi Gong
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Motivated by the fact that the frequency and time information of modulated radio signals are crucial for modulation mode recognition, this paper proposes a frequency-time attention mechanism for a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based modulation recognition framework.
