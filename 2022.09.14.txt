83, TITLE: Adversarial Coreset Selection for Efficient Robust Training
AUTHORS: Hadi M. Dolatabadi ; Sarah Erfani ; Christopher Leckie
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In particular, we show that the convergence bound is directly related to how well our coresets can approximate the gradient computed over the entire training data. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we propose using this gradient approximation error as our adversarial coreset selection objective to reduce the training set size effectively.

92, TITLE: Learning to Prevent Profitless Neural Code Completion
AUTHORS: ZHENSU SUN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To fill this gap, we first investigate the prompts of these completions and find four observable prompt patterns, which demonstrate the feasibility of identifying such prompts based on prompts themselves. Motivated by this finding, we propose an early-rejection mechanism to turn down low-return prompts by foretelling the completion qualities without sending them to the LCM.

In this paper, we present AnICA, a tool taking inspiration from differential testing and abstract interpretation to systematically analyze inconsistencies among these code analyzers.

98, TITLE: Variational Causal Inference
AUTHORS: Yulun Wu ; Layne C. Price ; Zichen Wang ; Vassilis N. Ioannidis ; George Karypis
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.ST, q-bio.GN, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: In this case, to construct one's outcome under a counterfactual treatment, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its observed factual outcome on top of the covariates. We propose a deep variational Bayesian framework that rigorously integrates two main sources of information for outcome construction under a counterfactual treatment: one source is the individual features embedded in the high-dimensional factual outcome; the other source is the response distribution of similar subjects (subjects with the same covariates) that factually received this treatment of interest.

99, TITLE: Learning ASR Pathways: A Sparse Multilingual ASR Model
AUTHORS: MU YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in multilingual ASR, performing language-agnostic pruning may lead to severe performance degradation on some languages because language-agnostic pruning masks may not fit all languages and discard important language-specific parameters. In this work, we present ASR pathways, a sparse multilingual ASR model that activates language-specific sub-networks ("pathways"), such that the parameters for each language are learned explicitly.
