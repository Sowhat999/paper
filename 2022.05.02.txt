8, TITLE: Por Qué Não Utiliser Alla Språk? Mixed Training with Gradient Optimization in Few-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer
AUTHORS: Haoran Xu ; Kenton Murray
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The current state-of-the-art for few-shot cross-lingual transfer learning first trains on abundant labeled data in the source language and then fine-tunes with a few examples on the target language, termed target-adapting. Though this has been demonstrated to work on a variety of tasks, in this paper we show some deficiencies of this approach and propose a one-step mixed training method that trains on both source and target data with \textit{stochastic gradient surgery}, a novel gradient-level optimization.

To this end, instead of directly adopting automatically generated speech transcripts with highly noisy data, we propose a novel unified data distillation approach, DDNet, which effectively ingests cross-modal information to achieve fine-grained representations of the speech and language modalities.

12, TITLE: Detecting Textual Adversarial Examples Based on Distributional Characteristics of Data Representations
AUTHORS: Na Liu ; Mark Dras ; Wei Emma Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While there is some work in NLP on defending against such attacks through proactive methods, like adversarial training, there is to our knowledge no effective general reactive approaches to defence via detection of textual adversarial examples such as is found in the image processing literature. In this paper, we propose two new reactive methods for NLP to fill this gap, which unlike the few limited application baselines from NLP are based entirely on distribution characteristics of learned representations: we adapt one from the image processing literature (Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID)), and propose a novel one (MultiDistance Representation Ensemble Method (MDRE)).

64, TITLE: A Deep Learning Based No-reference Quality Assessment Model for UGC Videos
AUTHORS: Wei Sun ; Xiongkuo Min ; Wei Lu ; Guangtao Zhai
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.MM, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous UGC video quality assessment (VQA) studies either use the image recognition model or the image quality assessment (IQA) models to extract frame-level features of UGC videos for quality regression, which are regarded as the sub-optimal solutions because of the domain shifts between these tasks and the UGC VQA task. In this paper, we propose a very simple but effective UGC VQA model, which tries to address this problem by training an end-to-end spatial feature extraction network to directly learn the quality-aware spatial feature representation from raw pixels of the video frames.

70, TITLE: A Bottom-Up End-User Intelligent Assistant Approach to Empower Gig Workers Against AI Inequality
AUTHORS: TOBY JIA-JUN LI et. al.

In this position paper, we argue that a bottom-up approach that empowers individual workers to access AI-enabled work planning support and share data among a group of workers through a network of end-user-programmable intelligent assistants is a practical way to bridge AI inequality in gig work under the current paradigm of privately owned platforms.

81, TITLE: A Suite of Diagnostic Metrics for Characterizing Selection Schemes
AUTHORS: Jose Guadalupe Hernandez ; Alexander Lalejini ; Charles Ofria
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we use our diagnostics to evaluate six population selection methods: truncation selection, tournament selection, fitness sharing, lexicase selection, nondominated sorting, and novelty search.

82, TITLE: Lipschitz-based Surrogate Model for High-dimensional Computationally Expensive Problems
AUTHORS: Jakub Kudela ; Radomil Matousek
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, math.OC]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel surrogate model based on a Lipschitz underestimation of the expensive-to-compute objective function.

83, TITLE: A First Runtime Analysis of The NSGA-II on A Multimodal Problem
AUTHORS: Zhongdi Qu ; Benjamin Doerr
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.DS, math.OC]
HIGHLIGHT: Overall, this work shows that the NSGA-II copes with the local optima of the OneJumpZeroJump problem at least as well as the global SEMO algorithm.

84, TITLE: Pragmatic Clinical Trials in The Rubric of Structural Causal Models
AUTHORS: Riddhiman Adib ; Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed ; Mohammad Adibuzzaman
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Due to its pragmatic nature, no standardized representation of PCT through SCM has been yet established. In this paper, we approach this problem by proposing a generalized representation of PCT under the rubric of structural causal models (SCM).

85, TITLE: Noise-reducing Attention Cross Fusion Learning Transformer for Histological Image Classification of Osteosarcoma
AUTHORS: LIANGRUI PAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The purpose of this study is to use artificial intelligence to classify osteosarcoma histological images and to assess tumor survival and necrosis, which will help doctors reduce their workload, improve the accuracy of osteosarcoma cancer detection, and make a better prognosis for patients.

86, TITLE: COVID-Net US-X: Enhanced Deep Neural Network for Detection of COVID-19 Patient Cases from Convex Ultrasound Imaging Through Extended Linear-Convex Ultrasound Augmentation Learning
AUTHORS: E. Zhixuan Zeng ; Adrian Florea ; Alexander Wong
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we explore the impact of leveraging extended linear-convex ultrasound augmentation learning on producing enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 assessment, where we conduct data augmentation on convex probe data alongside linear probe data that have been transformed to better resemble convex probe data.

87, TITLE: Preoperative Brain Tumor Imaging: Models and Software for Segmentation and Standardized Reporting
AUTHORS: D. BOUGET et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, I.4.6; J.3]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we investigate glioblastomas, lower grade gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases, through four cohorts of up to 4000 patients.

88, TITLE: Segmentation of Kidney Stones in Endoscopic Video Feeds
AUTHORS: Zachary A Stoebner ; Daiwei Lu ; Seok Hee Hong ; Nicholas L Kavoussi ; Ipek Oguz
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we describe how we built a dataset from the raw videos and how we developed a pipeline to automate as much of the process as possible.

89, TITLE: Adversarial Distortion Learning for Medical Image Denoising
AUTHORS: Morteza Ghahremani ; Mohammad Khateri ; Alejandra Sierra ; Jussi Tohka
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a novel adversarial distortion learning (ADL) for denoising two- and three-dimensional (2D/3D) biomedical image data.

90, TITLE: One Model to Synthesize Them All: Multi-contrast Multi-scale Transformer for Missing Data Imputation
AUTHORS: JIANG LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we formulate missing data imputation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem and propose a multi-contrast multi-scale Transformer (MMT), which can take any subset of input contrasts and synthesize those that are missing.
