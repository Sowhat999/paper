HIGHLIGHT: In this work it is shown that the distance between the feature encodings of clean and noisy speech correlate strongly with psychoacoustically motivated measures of speech quality and intelligibility, as well as with human Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings.

85, TITLE: Pyssam -- A Python Library for Statistical Modelling of Biomedical Shape and Appearance
AUTHORS: Josh Williams ; Ali Ozel ; Uwe Wolfram
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: pyssam is a Python library for creating statistical shape and appearance models (SSAMs) for biological (and other) shapes such as bones, lungs or other organs.

86, TITLE: ODIM: An Efficient Method to Detect Outliers Via Inlier-memorization Effect of Deep Generative Models
AUTHORS: Dongha Kim ; Jaesung Hwang ; Jongjin Lee ; Kunwoong Kim ; Yongdai Kim
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a powerful and efficient learning framework to identify outliers in a training data set using deep neural networks.

87, TITLE: Modelling Low-resource Accents Without Accent-specific TTS Frontend
AUTHORS: Georgi Tinchev ; Marta Czarnowska ; Kamil Deja ; Kayoko Yanagisawa ; Marius Cotescu
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: This work focuses on modelling a speaker's accent that does not have a dedicated text-to-speech (TTS) frontend, including a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) module.

88, TITLE: Multi-Scanner Canine Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Histopathology Dataset
AUTHORS: FRAUKE WILM et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a publicly available multi-scanner dataset of canine cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma histopathology images, composed of 44 samples digitized with five slide scanners.

89, TITLE: An Atrium Segmentation Network with Location Guidance and Siamese Adjustment
AUTHORS: Yuhan Xie ; Zhiyong Zhang ; Shaolong Chen ; Changzhen Qiu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.6]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an atrium segmentation network LGSANet with location guidance and siamese adjustment, which takes adjacent three slices of images as input and adopts an end-to-end approach to achieve coarse-to-fine atrial segmentation.

90, TITLE: Clustering Disease Trajectories in Contrastive Feature Space for Biomarker Discovery in Age-related Macular Degeneration
AUTHORS: ROBBIE HOLLAND et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we are the first to analyse disease progression as clustered trajectories in a self-supervised feature space.
