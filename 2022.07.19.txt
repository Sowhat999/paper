We derive conditions that characterize the tightness of this SDR, showing that the tightness depends on the noise level, the truncation parameters of TLS, and the outlier distribution (random or clustered).

8, TITLE: DHGE: Dual-view Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Embedding for Link Prediction and Entity Typing
AUTHORS: HAORAN LUO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the existing hyper-relational KG embedding methods in a single view are limited in application due to weakening the hierarchical structure representing the affiliation between entities. To break this limitation, we propose a dual-view hyper-relational KG (DH-KG) structure which contains a hyper-relational instance view for entities and a hyper-relational ontology view for concepts abstracted hierarchically from entities to jointly model hyper-relational and hierarchical information.

28, TITLE: Automatic Context Pattern Generation for Entity Set Expansion
AUTHORS: YINGHUI LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.IR]
HIGHLIGHT: A non-negligible shortcoming of the pre-defined context patterns is that they cannot be flexibly generalized to all kinds of semantic classes, and we call this phenomenon as "semantic sensitivity". To address this problem, we devise a context pattern generation module that utilizes autoregressive language models (e.g., GPT-2) to automatically generate high-quality context patterns for entities.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual knowledge-enhanced generative pretrained language model for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems (DKMD), consisting of three key components: dual knowledge selection, dual knowledge-enhanced context learning, and knowledge-enhanced response generation.

AUTHORS: Edith Elkind ; Abheek Ghosh ; Paul W. Goldberg
CATEGORY: cs.GT [cs.GT, cs.CC, econ.TH]

AUTHORS: Jingjia Huang ; Baixiang Yang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We argue that the independent use of the bottom-up parsing strategy in HOI is counter-intuitive and could lead to the diffusion of attention. Therefore, we introduce a novel knowledge-guided top-down attention into HOI, and propose to model the relation parsing as a "look and search" process: execute scene-context modeling (i.e. look), and then, given the knowledge of the target pair, search visual clues for the discrimination of the interaction between the pair.

AUTHORS: QIYING YU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this mechanism can be potentially flawed, since adversarial perturbations may cause instance-level identity confusion, which can impede CL performance by pulling together different instances with separate identities. To address this issue, we propose to treat adversarial samples unequally when contrasted, with an asymmetric InfoNCE objective ($A-InfoNCE$) that allows discriminating considerations of adversarial samples.

HIGHLIGHT: However, optical flow is intrinsically an instantaneous velocity of all pixels among consecutive frames, thus making the motion features not aligned well with the primary objects among the corresponding frames. To solve the above challenge, we propose a concise, practical, and efficient architecture for appearance and motion feature alignment, dubbed hierarchical feature alignment network (HFAN).

74, TITLE: Mind The Gap: Polishing Pseudo Labels for Accurate Semi-supervised Object Detection

In this paper, we introduce AdaMatcher, a novel detector-free local feature matching method, which first correlates dense features by a lightweight feature interaction module and estimates co-visible area of the paired images, then performs a patch-level many-to-one assignment to predict match proposals, and finally refines them based on a one-to-one refinement module.

AUTHORS: Haimei Zhao ; Jing Zhang ; Sen Zhang ; Dacheng Tao
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: A naive way is to accomplish them independently in a sequential or parallel manner, but there are many drawbacks, i.e., 1) the depth and VO results suffer from the inherent scale ambiguity issue; 2) the BEV layout is directly predicted from the front-view image without using any depth-related information, although the depth map contains useful geometry clues for inferring scene layouts. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a novel joint perception framework named JPerceiver, which can simultaneously estimate scale-aware depth and VO as well as BEV layout from a monocular video sequence.

To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes.

AUTHORS: DAQIAN SHI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: There are limitations when applying current image restoration methods to such real-world character images, since (i) the categories of noise in character images are different from those in general images; (ii) real-world character images usually contain more complex image degradation, e.g., mixed noise at different noise levels. To address these problems, we propose a real-world character restoration network (RCRN) to effectively restore degraded character images, where character skeleton information and scale-ensemble feature extraction are utilized to obtain better restoration performance.

CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a bespoke full reference video quality metric for VFI, FloLPIPS, that builds on the popular perceptual image quality metric, LPIPS, which captures the perceptual degradation in extracted image feature space.

240, TITLE: CACTUSS: Common Anatomical CT-US Space for US Examinations
AUTHORS: YORDANKA VELIKOVA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Knowledge gathered from this solved task could therefore be leveraged to improve US segmentation for AAA diagnosis and monitoring. To this end, we propose CACTUSS: a common anatomical CT-US space, which acts as a virtual bridge between CT and US modalities to enable automatic AAA screening sonography.

241, TITLE: Unsupervised Medical Image Translation with Adversarial Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: MUZAFFER ÖZBEY et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose a novel method based on adversarial diffusion modeling, SynDiff, for improved reliability in medical image synthesis.

242, TITLE: BCS-Net: Boundary, Context and Semantic for Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images
AUTHORS: RUNMIN CONG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, there are several challenges for the accurate and complete segmentation, such as the scattered infection area distribution, complex background noises, and blurred segmentation boundaries. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel network for automatic COVID-19 lung infection segmentation from CT images, named BCS-Net, which considers the boundary, context, and semantic attributes.

243, TITLE: MLP-GAN for Brain Vessel Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Bin Xie ; Hao Tang ; Bin Duan ; Dawen Cai ; Yan Yan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: One successful approach is to consider the segmentation as an image-to-image translation task and perform a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to learn a transformation between two distributions. In this paper, we present a novel multi-view approach, MLP-GAN, which splits a 3D volumetric brain vessel image into three different dimensional 2D images (i.e., sagittal, coronal, axial) and then feed them into three different 2D cGANs.
