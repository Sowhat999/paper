AUTHORS: Dongyue Guo ; Jianwei Zhang ; Bo Yang ; Yi Lin
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we formulate the SRI task of controller-pilot communication as a binary classification problem.

88, TITLE: The Effect of Synaptic Weight Initialization in Feature-based Successor Representation Learning
AUTHORS: Hyunsu Lee
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, SF learners were exposed to simple maze environments to analyze SF learning efficiency and W patterns pattern changes.

89, TITLE: Numerical Smoothing with Hierarchical Adaptive Sparse Grids and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods for Efficient Option Pricing
AUTHORS: Christian Bayer ; Chiheb Ben Hammouda ; Raúl Tempone
CATEGORY: q-fin.CP [q-fin.CP, cs.CC, cs.CE, cs.NA, math.NA, q-fin.PR, 65C05, 65D30, 65D32, 65Y20, 91G20, 91G60]
HIGHLIGHT: To overcome this issue and reveal the available regularity, we consider cases in which analytic smoothing cannot be performed, and introduce a novel numerical smoothing approach by combining a root finding algorithm with one-dimensional integration with respect to a single well-selected variable.

90, TITLE: Implicit Deep Adaptive Design: Policy-Based Experimental Design Without Likelihoods
AUTHORS: Desi R. Ivanova ; Adam Foster ; Steven Kleinegesse ; Michael U. Gutmann ; Tom Rainforth
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.CO]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce implicit Deep Adaptive Design (iDAD), a new method for performing adaptive experiments in real-time with implicit models.

91, TITLE: A Causality-based Graphical Test to Obtain An Optimal Blocking Set for Randomized Experiments
AUTHORS: Abhishek K. Umrawal
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI, cs.LG, econ.EM, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: We formalize the problem of obtaining a statistically optimal set of covariates to be used to create blocks while performing a randomized experiment.

92, TITLE: Learned Image Compression for Machine Perception
AUTHORS: Felipe Codevilla ; Jean Gabriel Simard ; Ross Goroshin ; Chris Pal
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we develop a framework that produces a compression format suitable for both human perception and machine perception.

93, TITLE: 3-D PET Image Generation with Tumour Masks Using TGAN
AUTHORS: ROBERT V BERGEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: To address these issues we propose adapting video generation techniques for 3-D image generation.
