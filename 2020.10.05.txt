52, TITLE:      A Gradient Flow Framework For Analyzing Network Pruning
http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11839
AUTHORS:        Ekdeep Singh Lubana ; Robert P. Dick
CATEGORY:       cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT:      We use this framework to determine the relationship between pruning measures and evolution of model parameters, establishing several results related to pruning models early-on in training: (i) magnitude-based pruning removes parameters that contribute least to reduction in loss, resulting in models that converge faster than magnitude-agnostic methods; (ii) loss-preservation based pruning preserves first-order model evolution dynamics and is therefore appropriate for pruning minimally trained models; and (iii) gradient-norm based pruning affects second-order model evolution dynamics, such that increasing gradient norm via pruning can produce poorly performing models.
