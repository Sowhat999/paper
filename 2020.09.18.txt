HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we present a principle that we call Feature Purification, where we show one of the causes of the existence of adversarial examples is the accumulation of certain small dense mixtures in the hidden weights during the training process of a neural network; and more importantly, one of the goals of adversarial training is to remove such mixtures to purify hidden weights.

CATEGORY:       cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NE, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT:      To mitigate this concern, we propose a privacy-preserving-oriented pruning and mobile acceleration framework that does not require the private training dataset.

HIGHLIGHT:      We propose a simple but effective way for few-shot classification in which a task distribution spans multiple domains including ones never seen during meta-training.

48, TITLE:      Frivolous Units: Wider Networks Are Not Really That Wide
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04783
AUTHORS:        Stephen Casper ; Xavier Boix ; Vanessa D'Amario ; Ling Guo ; Martin Schrimpf ; Kasper Vinken ; Gabriel Kreiman
CATEGORY:       cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT:      We identify two distinct types of "frivolous" units that proliferate when the network's width is increased: prunable units which can be dropped out of the network without significant change to the output and redundant units whose activities can be expressed as a linear combination of others.

COMMENTS:       NeurIPS 2019
CATEGORY:       cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT:      We find that both methods improve robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the high frequency domain while reducing robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the low frequency domain.

CATEGORY:       cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT:      To this end, we propose infoCAM, informative class activation map, which highlights regions of the input image that are the most relevant to a given label based on differences in information.

HIGHLIGHT:      In this thesis we look into programming by example (PBE), which is about finding a program mapping given inputs to given outputs. We further explain how we generated a dataset within our domain, which uses a limited subset of Haskell as the synthesis language.
