246, TITLE: Data Accounting and Error Counting
AUTHORS: Micha? J. Gajda
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.IT, math.IT, math.OC, H.1.1; J.1; I.1.3; H.2.3; H.4.2; B.4.5; F.4.m]
HIGHLIGHT: This allows us to achieve holy grail of automated approaches to debugging, risk reporting and large scale distributed error tracking. Since processing of risk reports and data analysis pipelines can be frequently expressed using a sequence relational algebra operations, we propose a replacement of this traditional approach with a data summarization algebra that helps to determine an impact of errors.

247, TITLE: RREx-BoT: Remote Referring Expressions with A Bag of Tricks
AUTHORS: Gunnar A. Sigurdsson ; Jesse Thomason ; Gaurav S. Sukhatme ; Robinson Piramuthu
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, benchmarks in robot learning often test generalization through inference on tasks in unobserved environments. In an observed environment, locating an object is reduced to choosing from among all object proposals in the environment, which may number in the 100,000s. Armed with this intuition, using only a generic vision-language scoring model with minor modifications for 3d encoding and operating in an embodied environment, we demonstrate an absolute performance gain of 9.84% on remote object grounding above state of the art models for REVERIE and of 5.04% on FAO.

To alleviate this, we show two methods that can be used to improve the smoothness of steering.

256, TITLE: Quantifying and Maximizing The Information Flux in Recurrent Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Claus Metzner ; Marius E. Yamakou ; Dennis Voelkl ; Achim Schilling ; Patrick Krauss
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Although, former studies have shown that $I$ depends on the statistics of the network's connection weights, it is unclear (1) how to maximize $I$ systematically and (2) how to quantify the flux in large systems where computing the mutual information becomes intractable. Here, we address these questions using Boltzmann machines as model systems.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the Cobb angle by developing an automated radiation-free model, using Machine learning algorithms.
