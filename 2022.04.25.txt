In this work, we conjecture that this maladaptation lies in the backbone of IQA models, where patch-level prediction methods use independent image patches as input to calculate their scores separately, but lack spatial relationship modeling among image patches.

83, TITLE: Recurrent Affine Transformation for Text-to-image Synthesis
AUTHORS: Senmao Ye ; Fei Liu ; Minkui Tan
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, isolated fusion blocks not only conflict with each other but also increase the difficulty of training (see first page of the supplementary). To address these issues, we propose a Recurrent Affine Transformation (RAT) for Generative Adversarial Networks that connects all the fusion blocks with a recurrent neural network to model their long-term dependency.

84, TITLE: Dynamic Prototype Convolution Network for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation
AUTHORS: JIE LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these interaction approaches usually cannot well capture the intrinsic object details in the query images that are widely encountered in FSS, e.g., if the query object to be segmented has holes and slots, inaccurate segmentation almost always happens. To this end, we propose a dynamic prototype convolution network (DPCN) to fully capture the aforementioned intrinsic details for accurate FSS.

85, TITLE: Learning Dynamic View Synthesis With Few RGBD Cameras
AUTHORS: SHENGZE WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.GR, I.4; I.3]
HIGHLIGHT: However, current deep learning models often require (1) prior models (e.g., SMPL human models), (2) heavy pre-processing, or (3) per-scene optimization. We propose to utilize RGBD cameras to remove these limitations and synthesize free-viewpoint videos of dynamic indoor scenes.

AUTHORS: Yuanzhen Luo ; Qiang Lu ; Xilei Hu ; Jake Luo ; Zhiguang Wang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE]

99, TITLE: Learning to Scaffold: Optimizing Model Explanations for Teaching
AUTHORS: Patrick Fernandes ; Marcos Treviso ; Danish Pruthi ; André F. T. Martins ; Graham Neubig
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Some research argues that explanations should help teach a student (either human or machine) to simulate the model being explained, and that the quality of explanations can be measured by the simulation accuracy of students on unexplained examples. In this work, leveraging meta-learning techniques, we extend this idea to improve the quality of the explanations themselves, specifically by optimizing explanations such that student models more effectively learn to simulate the original model.

HIGHLIGHT: Few methods exist in the literature that address this task when some of the variables are categorical in nature. We formalize an analogy between categorical time series and classical Natural Language Processing and demonstrate the strength of this analogy for anomaly detection and root cause investigation by implementing and testing three different machine learning anomaly detection and root cause investigation models based upon it.

To address this issue, this paper presents a bidirectional transformation system between functional and object-oriented decomposition.
