	We present a hybrid dynamical type theory equipped with useful 
primitives for organizing and proving safety of navigational control 
algorithms.

80, TITLE:	Solving The Funarg Problem with Static Types
AUTHORS:	Caleb Helbling ; F?rat Aksoy
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL, 68N15, D.3.3; D.1.1]
HIGHLIGHT:	We present a simple extension to the prenex fragment of System F that allows closures to be stack-allocated.

81, TITLE:	Symbolic Automatic Relations and Their Applications to SMT and CHC Solving
AUTHORS:	Takumi Shimoda ; Naoki Kobayashi ; Ken Sakayori ; Ryosuke Sato
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	To address the challenge, we introduce the notion of symbolic automatic
 relations (SARs), which combines symbolic automata and automatic 
relations, and inherits their good properties such as the closure under 
Boolean operations.

82, TITLE:	Improving Thread-Modular Abstract Interpretation
AUTHORS:	MICHAEL SCHWARZ et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT:	We give thread-modular non-relational value analyses as abstractions of a local trace semantics.

83, TITLE:	On Incorrectness Logic and Kleene Algebra With Top and Tests
AUTHORS:	Cheng Zhang ; Arthur Azevedo de Amorim ; Marco Gaboardi
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we investigate the support that KAT provides for 
reasoning about \emph{incorrectness}, instead, as embodied by Ohearn's 
recently proposed incorrectness logic.

84, TITLE:	Monolithic Vs. Hybrid Controller for Multi-objective Sim-to-Real Learning
AUTHORS:	ATAKAN DAG et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we compare these two approaches in the multi-objective 
setting of a robot manipulator to reach a target while avoiding an 
obstacle.

85, TITLE:	InfoGram and Admissible Machine Learning
AUTHORS:	Subhadeep Mukhopadhyay
CATEGORY:	stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, econ.EM]
HIGHLIGHT:
	The purpose of this article is to introduce a new information-theoretic
 learning framework (admissible machine learning) and algorithmic 
risk-management tools (InfoGram, L-features, ALFA-testing) that can 
guide an analyst to redesign off-the-shelf ML methods to be regulatory 
compliant, while maintaining good prediction accuracy.

86, TITLE:	Deep MRI Reconstruction with Radial Subsampling
AUTHORS:	George Yiasemis ; Chaoping Zhang ; Clara I. Sánchez ; Jan-Jakob Sonke ; Jonas Teuwen
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper we compare and provide a review for the effect of 
applying either rectilinear or radial retrospective subsampling on the 
quality of the reconstructions outputted by trained deep neural 
networks.

87, TITLE:	A New Backbone for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction
AUTHORS:	Jiamian Wang ; Yulun Zhang ; Xin Yuan ; Yun Fu ; Zhiqiang Tao
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:	In this paper, we fill in this blank by proposing a Spatial/Spectral Invariant Residual U-Net, namely SSI-ResU-Net.

88, TITLE:	Spectrai: A Deep Learning Framework for Spectral Data
AUTHORS:	Conor C. Horgan ; Mads S. Bergholt
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Here we present spectrai, an open-source deep learning framework 
designed to facilitate the training of neural networks on spectral data 
and enable comparison between different methods.
