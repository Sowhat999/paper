HIGHLIGHT: We present a robust visual-inertial SLAM system that combines the benefits of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and planar constraints.

84, TITLE: RoboCraft: Learning to See, Simulate, and Shape Elasto-Plastic Objects with Graph Networks
AUTHORS: Haochen Shi ; Huazhe Xu ; Zhiao Huang ; Yunzhu Li ; Jiajun Wu
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, due to the high degree of freedom of elasto-plastic objects, significant challenges exist in virtually every aspect of the robotic manipulation pipeline, e.g., representing the states, modeling the dynamics, and synthesizing the control signals. We propose to tackle these challenges by employing a particle-based representation for elasto-plastic objects in a model-based planning framework.

AUTHORS: JONATHAN FRANCIS et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we describe the new L2R Task 2.0 benchmark, with refined metrics and baseline approaches.

86, TITLE: Characterizing Multi-Domain False News and Underlying User Effects on Chinese Weibo
AUTHORS: QIANG SHENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT: In this article, we investigate false news across nine domains on Weibo, the largest Twitter-like social media platform in China, from 2009 to 2019.

87, TITLE: Fake News Detection with Heterogeneous Transformer
AUTHORS: Tianle Li ; Yushi Sun ; Shang-ling Hsu ; Yanjia Li ; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based model: HetTransformer to solve the fake news detection problem on social networks, which utilises the encoder-decoder structure of Transformer to capture the structural information of news propagation patterns.

88, TITLE: Ontology Reuse: The Real Test of Ontological Design
AUTHORS: Piotr Sowinski ; Katarzyna Wasielewska-Michniewska ; Maria Ganzha ; Marcin Paprzycki ; Costin Badica
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, the quality of thirty biomedical ontologies, and the Computer Science Ontology, are investigated from the perspective of a practical use case.

89, TITLE: Sound2Synth: Interpreting Sound Via FM Synthesizer Parameters Estimation
AUTHORS: ZUI CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: The problem of estimating a set of parameters configuration that best restore a sound timbre is an important yet complicated problem, i.e.: the synthesizer parameters estimation problem. We proposed a multi-modal deep-learning-based pipeline Sound2Synth, together with a network structure Prime-Dilated Convolution (PDC) specially designed to solve this problem.
