AUTHORS:	George Panagopoulos ; Nikolaos Tziortziotis ; Fragkiskos D. Malliaros ; Michalis Vazirgiannis
CATEGORY:	cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SI]

	To showcase this, we propose a version of a standard Influence 
Maximization (IM) algorithm where we substitute traditional influence 
estimation with the predictions of GLIE.We also transfer GLIE into a 
reinforcement learning model that learns how to choose seeds to maximize
 influence sequentially using GLIE's hidden representations and 
predictions.

AUTHORS:	Jin Huang ; Ming Xiao
CATEGORY:	cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This paper will present different ways of using high level latent 
random variables in RNN to model the variability in the sequential data,
 and the training method of such RNN model under the VAE (Variational 
Autoencoder) principle.

AUTHORS:	Sizhe Yuen ; Thomas H. G. Ezard ; Adam J. Sobey
CATEGORY:	cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:
	The framework shows a missing gap in epigenetic inheritance for 
Evolutionary Computation, despite being a key building block in modern 
interpretations of how evolution occurs.

89, TITLE:	Matchmaker, Matchmaker, Make Me A Match: Geometric, Variational, and Evolutionary Implications of Criteria for Tag Affinity
AUTHORS:	Matthew Andres Moreno ; Alexander Lalejini ; Charles Ofria
CATEGORY:	cs.NE [cs.NE]

AUTHORS:	Zhe Zhou ; Robert Dickerson ; Benjamin Delaware ; Suresh Jagannathan
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we present a novel data-driven abductive inference 
mechanism that infers specifications for library methods sufficient to 
enable verification of the library's clients.
