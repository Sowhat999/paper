HIGHLIGHT: Entropic Outlier Sparsification (EOS) is proposed as a robust computational strategy for the detection of data anomalies in a broad class of learning methods, including the unsupervised problems (like detection of non-Gaussian outliers in mostly-Gaussian data) and in the supervised learning with mislabeled data.

88, TITLE: The Phonetic Footprint of Parkinson's Disease
AUTHORS: PHILIPP KLUMPP et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we used a phonetic recognizer trained exclusively on healthy speech data to investigate how PD affected the phonetic footprint of patients.

90, TITLE: Community Detection in Medical Image Datasets: Using Wavelets and Spectral Methods
AUTHORS: Roozbeh Yousefzadeh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose an algorithm to facilitate the automatic identification of communities in medical image datasets.

91, TITLE: Teacher-Student Architecture for Mixed Supervised Lung Tumor Segmentation
AUTHORS: VEMUND FREDRIKSEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, I.4.6, I.4.6; I.4.9; I.5.4; J.3]
HIGHLIGHT: Methods: This paper investigates the use of a teacher-student design to utilize datasets with different types of supervision to train an automatic model performing pulmonary tumor segmentation on computed tomography images.
