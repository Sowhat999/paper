AUTHORS: Benjia Zhou ; Pichao Wang ; Jun Wan ; Yanyan Liang ; Fan Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: Although improving motion recognition to some extent, these methods still face sub-optimal situations in the following aspects: (i) Data augmentation, i.e., the scale of the RGB-D datasets is still limited, and few efforts have been made to explore novel data augmentation strategies for videos; (ii) Optimization mechanism, i.e., the tightly space-time-entangled network structure brings more challenges to spatiotemporal information modeling; And (iii) cross-modal knowledge fusion, i.e., the high similarity between multimodal representations caused to insufficient late fusion. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to improve RGB-D-based motion recognition both from data and algorithm perspectives in this paper.
