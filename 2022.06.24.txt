53, TITLE: Entropy-driven Sampling and Training Scheme for Conditional Diffusion Generation
AUTHORS: SHENGMING LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, due to the ability of classifier to easily discriminate an incompletely generated image only with high-level structure, the gradient, which is a kind of class information guidance, tends to vanish early, leading to the collapse from conditional generation process into the unconditional process. To address this problem, we propose two simple but effective approaches from two perspectives.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose Non-Parametric learning by Compression with Latent Variables (NPC-LV), a learning framework for any dataset with abundant unlabeled data but very few labeled ones.

82, TITLE: PAC: Assisted Value Factorisation with Counterfactual Predictions in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Hanhan Zhou ; Tian Lan ; Vaneet Aggarwal
CATEGORY: cs.MA [cs.MA, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show that in partially observable MARL problems, an agent's ordering over its own actions could impose concurrent constraints (across different states) on the representable function class, causing significant estimation error during training. We tackle this limitation and propose PAC, a new framework leveraging Assistive information generated from Counterfactual Predictions of optimal joint action selection, which enable explicit assistance to value function factorization through a novel counterfactual loss.

83, TITLE: Recommendations for Systematic Research on Emergent Language
AUTHORS: Brendon Boldt ; David Mortensen
CATEGORY: cs.MA [cs.MA, cs.CL, I.2.11; I.6.m; K.4.m]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet after these problems have been established, subsequent progress requires research which can measurably demonstrate how it improves on prior approaches. This type of research is what we call systematic research; in this paper, we illustrate this mode of research specifically for emergent language.

AUTHORS: YUE XIE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show how evolutionary algorithms can be used to promote health and well-being by optimizing time usage.

HIGHLIGHT: We present a multi-stage pipeline for simple gesture recognition.

87, TITLE: Waypoint Generation in Row-based Crops with Deep Learning and Contrastive Clustering
AUTHORS: Francesco Salvetti ; Simone Angarano ; Mauro Martini ; Simone Cerrato ; Marcello Chiaberge
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach to tackle waypoint generation for planning a navigation path for row-based crops, starting from a top-view map of the region-of-interest.

88, TITLE: Learning Agile Skills Via Adversarial Imitation of Rough Partial Demonstrations
AUTHORS: CHENHAO LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a generative adversarial method for inferring reward functions from partial and potentially physically incompatible demonstrations for successful skill acquirement where reference or expert demonstrations are not easily accessible.

89, TITLE: Graph-Based Multi-Robot Path Finding and Planning
AUTHORS: Hang Ma
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT: Purpose of Review Planning collision-free paths for multiple robots is important for real-world multi-robot systems and has been studied as an optimization problem on graphs, called Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF).

90, TITLE: Single-phase Deep Learning in Cortico-cortical Networks
AUTHORS: Will Greedy ; Heng Wei Zhu ; Joseph Pemberton ; Jack Mellor ; Rui Ponte Costa
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these models are either unable to effectively backpropagate error signals across multiple layers or require a multi-phase learning process, neither of which are reminiscent of learning in the brain. Here, we introduce a new model, bursting cortico-cortical networks (BurstCCN), which solves these issues by integrating known properties of cortical networks namely bursting activity, short-term plasticity (STP) and dendrite-targeting interneurons.

91, TITLE: A Temporal Extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery
AUTHORS: Werner van der Merwe ; Herman Kamper ; Johan du Preez
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present an extension to LDA that uses a Markov chain to model temporal information.

92, TITLE: Two-pass Decoding and Cross-adaptation Based System Combination of End-to-end Conformer and Hybrid TDNN ASR Systems
AUTHORS: MINGYU CUI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper investigates multi-pass rescoring and cross adaptation based system combination approaches for hybrid TDNN and Conformer E2E ASR systems.

93, TITLE: Universal Learned Image Compression With Low Computational Cost
AUTHORS: BOWEN LI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the learning-based methods suffer from high computational costs, which is not beneficial for deployment on devices with limited resources. To this end, we propose shift-addition parallel modules (SAPMs), including SAPM-E for the encoder and SAPM-D for the decoder, to largely reduce the energy consumption.
