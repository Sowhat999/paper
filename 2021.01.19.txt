CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a novel deep symmetric architecture of UDA for medical image segmentation, which consists of a segmentation sub-network, and two symmetric source and target domain translation sub-networks.

171, TITLE: Uncertainty-Aware Body Composition Analysis with Deep Regression Ensembles on UK Biobank MRI
AUTHORS: TARO LANGNER et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this retrospective study, neural networks were trained to provide six measurements of body composition from UK Biobank neck-to-knee body MRI.

172, TITLE: Covid-19 Classification with Deep Neural Network and Belief Functions
AUTHORS: Ling Huang ; Su Ruan ; Thierry Denoeux
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a belief function-based convolutional neural network with semi-supervised training to detect Covid-19 cases.

173, TITLE: Comparing Deep Learning Strategies for Paired But Unregistered Multimodal Segmentation of The Liver in T1 and T2-weighted MRI
AUTHORS: VINCENT COUTEAUX et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.6]
HIGHLIGHT: We address the problem of multimodal liver segmentation in paired but unregistered T1 and T2-weighted MR images.
