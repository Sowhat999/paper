99, TITLE: Indoor Localization Under Limited Measurements: A Cross-Environment Joint Semi-Supervised and Transfer Learning Approach
AUTHORS: Mohamed I. AlHajri ; Raed M. Shubair ; Marwa Chafii
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.IT, math.IT]
HIGHLIGHT: To overcome the challenge of collecting costly measurements, this paper proposes a cross-environment approach that compensates for insufficient labelled measurements via a joint semi-supervised and transfer learning technique to transfer, in an appropriate manner, the model obtained from a rich-data environment to the desired environment for which data is limited.
