AUTHORS: Miriam Rateike ; Ayan Majumdar ; Olga Mineeva ; Krishna P. Gummadi ; Isabel Valera
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a variational autoencoder for practical fair decision-making.

82, TITLE: Explainable Deep Learning Methods in Medical Diagnosis: A Survey
AUTHORS: Cristiano Patrício ; João C. Neves ; Luís F. Teixeira
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The black-box-ness of deep learning models has raised the need for devising strategies to explain the decision process of these models, leading to the creation of the topic of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this context, we provide a thorough survey of XAI applied to medical diagnosis, including visual, textual, and example-based explanation methods.

83, TITLE: Disentangling A Single MR Modality
AUTHORS: LIANRUI ZUO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a novel framework that learns theoretically and practically superior disentanglement from single modality magnetic resonance images.

84, TITLE: Efficient Burst Raw Denoising with Variance Stabilization and Multi-frequency Denoising Network
AUTHORS: DASONG LI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective burst denoising system.

85, TITLE: Robust Medical Image Classification from Noisy Labeled Data with Global and Local Representation Guided Co-training
AUTHORS: Cheng Xue ; Lequan Yu ; Pengfei Chen ; Qi Dou ; Pheng-Ann Heng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative training paradigm with global and local representation learning for robust medical image classification from noisy-labeled data to combat the lack of high quality annotated medical data.

86, TITLE: A Closer Look at Blind Super-Resolution: Degradation Models, Baselines, and Performance Upper Bounds
AUTHORS: Wenlong Zhang ; Guangyuan Shi ; Yihao Liu ; Chao Dong ; Xiao-Ming Wu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The recently proposed practical degradation model includes a full spectrum of degradation types, but only considers complex cases that use all degradation types in the degradation process, while ignoring many important corner cases that are common in the real world. To address this problem, we propose a unified gated degradation model to generate a broad set of degradation cases using a random gate controller.

87, TITLE: Self-supervised Regression Learning Using Domain Knowledge: Applications to Improving Self-supervised Denoising in Imaging
AUTHORS: Il Yong Chun ; Dongwon Park ; Xuehang Zheng ; Se Young Chun ; Yong Long
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a general self-supervised regression learning (SSRL) framework that enables learning regression neural networks with only input data (but without ground-truth target data), by using a designable pseudo-predictor that encapsulates domain knowledge of a specific application.

88, TITLE: MNet: Rethinking 2D/3D Networks for Anisotropic Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: ZHANGFU DONG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, a novel mesh network (MNet) is proposed to balance the spatial representation inter axes via learning.

AUTHORS: SAI VIDYARANYA NUTHALAPATI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Deep learning models are leveraged to extract quantitative features from CT scans.
