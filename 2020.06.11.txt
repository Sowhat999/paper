37, TITLE:      X-Stance: A Multilingual Multi-Target Dataset for Stance Detection
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08385
AUTHORS:        Jannis Vamvas ; Rico Sennrich
COMMENTS:       SwissText + KONVENS 2020. Data and code are available at https://github.com/ZurichNLP/xstance

38, TITLE:      From Arguments to Key Points: Towards Automatic Argument Summarization
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01619
AUTHORS:        Roy Bar-Haim ; Lilach Eden ; Roni Friedman ; Yoav Kantor ; Dan Lahav ; Noam Slonim
COMMENTS:       ACL 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose to represent such summaries as a small set of talking points, termed "key points", each scored according to its salience. We study the task of argument-to-key point mapping, and introduce a novel large-scale dataset for this task.

39, TITLE:      Memory-Based Graph Networks

AUTHORS:        Amir Hosein Khasahmadi ; Kaveh Hassani ; Parsa Moradi ; Leo Lee ; Quaid Morris

40, TITLE:      Misinformation Has High Perplexity
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04666
AUTHORS:        Nayeon Lee ; Yejin Bang ; Andrea Madotto ; Pascale Fung
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we postulate that misinformation itself has higher perplexity compared to truthful statements, and propose to leverage the perplexity to debunk false claims in an unsupervised manner. We construct two new COVID-19-related test sets, one is scientific, and another is political in content, and empirically verify that our system performs favorably compared to existing systems. We are releasing these datasets publicly to encourage more research in debunking misinformation on COVID-19 and other topics.

42, TITLE:      Adaptive convolutional neural networks for k-space data interpolation in fast magnetic resonance imaging
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01385
AUTHORS:        Tianming Du ; Honggang Zhang ; Yuemeng Li ; Hee Kwon Song ; Yong Fan
HIGHLIGHT:      To overcome such limitations, we develop a deep learning algorithm, referred to as adaptive convolutional neural networks for k-space data interpolation (ACNN-k-Space), which adopts a residual Encoder-Decoder network architecture to interpolate the undersampled k-space data by integrating spatially contiguous slices as multi-channel input, along with k-space data from multiple coils if available.
