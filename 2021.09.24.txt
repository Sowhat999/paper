85, TITLE:	Leveraging
 Distributed Contact Force Measurements for Slip Detection: A 
Physics-based Approach Enabled By A Data-driven Tactile Sensor
AUTHORS:	Pietro Griffa ; Carmelo Sferrazza ; Raffaello D'Andrea
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]

	This paper describes a novel model-based slip detection pipeline that 
can predict possibly failing grasps in real-time and signal a necessary 
increase in grip force.

86, TITLE:	Tactile Grasp Refinement Using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Analytic Grasp Stability Metrics

	This work demonstrates that analytic grasp stability metrics constitute
 powerful optimization objectives for RL algorithms that refine grasps 
on a three-fingered hand using only tactile and joint position 
information.

87, TITLE:	Unseen Object Amodal Instance Segmentation Via Hierarchical Occlusion Modeling
AUTHORS:	SEUNGHYEOK BACK et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]

feature fusion and prediction order.

88, TITLE:	The Hilti SLAM Challenge Dataset
AUTHORS:	MICHAEL HELMBERGER et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:	To help this research, we propose a new dataset, the Hilti SLAM Challenge Dataset.

89, TITLE:	Joint Speaker Diarisation and Tracking in Switching State-space Model
AUTHORS:	Jeremy H. M. Wong ; Yifan Gong
CATEGORY:	cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG]

	A state-space model is proposed, where the hidden state expresses the 
identity of the current active speaker and the predicted locations of 
all speakers.

90, TITLE:	Clustering Performance Analysis Using New Correlation Based Cluster Validity Indices
AUTHORS:	Nathakhun Wiroonsri
CATEGORY:	stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG, 62H30, 68T10]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We develop two new cluster validity indices based on a correlation 
between an actual distance between a pair of data points and a centroid 
distance of clusters that the two points locate in.

91, TITLE:	Revisit Geophysical Imaging in A New View of Physics-informed Generative Adversarial Learning
AUTHORS:	Fangshu Yang ; Jianwei Ma
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Inspired by the competitive learning of generative adversarial 
networks, we proposed an unsupervised learning paradigm that integrates 
wave equation with a discriminate network to accurately estimate the 
physically consistent models in a distribution sense.

92, TITLE:	Rational Polynomial Camera Model Warping for Deep Learning Based Satellite Multi-View Stereo Matching
AUTHORS:	Jian Gao ; Jin Liu ; Shunping Ji
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we propose, for the first time, a rigorous RPC warping 
module. We also introduce a large-scale satellite image dataset 
consisting of 519 5120${\times}$5120 images, which we call the TLC 
SatMVS dataset.

from X-rays synthetically, we can improve the automatic disease 
classification accuracy and provide clinicians with a different look at 
the pulmonary disease process.
