HIGHLIGHT: Here we present SynthSR, a method to train a CNN that receives one or more thick-slice scans with different contrast, resolution and orientation, and produces an isotropic scan of canonical contrast (typically a 1 mm MP-RAGE).

86, TITLE: UMLE: Unsupervised Multi-discriminator Network For Low Light Enhancement
AUTHORS: Yangyang Qu ; Kai Chen ; Yongsheng Ou
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this problem, we propose a real-time unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN) containing multiple discriminators, i.e. a multi-scale discriminator, a texture discriminator, and a color discriminator.

87, TITLE: White Matter Hyperintensities Volume And Cognition: Assessment Of A Deep Learning Based Lesion Detection And Quantification Algorithm On The Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
AUTHORS: LAVANYA UMAPATHY et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we use a deep learning-based WMH segmentation algorithm, StackGen-Net, to detect and quantify WMH on 3D FLAIR volumes from ADNI.
