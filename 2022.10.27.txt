85, TITLE: CU-Net: LiDAR Depth-Only Completion With Coupled U-Net
AUTHORS: YUFEI WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We find that existing depth-only methods can obtain satisfactory results in the areas where the measurement points are almost accurate and evenly distributed (denoted as normal areas), while the performance is limited in the areas where the foreground and background points are overlapped due to occlusion (denoted as overlap areas) and the areas where there are no measurement points around (denoted as blank areas) since the methods have no reliable input information in these areas. Building upon these observations, we propose an effective Coupled U-Net (CU-Net) architecture for depth-only completion.
