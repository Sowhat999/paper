We present the Instance-specific ImageNav task (InstanceImageNav) to address these limitations.

64, TITLE: PatchMix Augmentation to Identify Causal Features in Few-shot Learning
AUTHORS: CHENGMING XU et. al.

In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing a simple yet effective normalization method that can effectively control both mean and variance of the weight distribution of novel classes without using any base samples and thereby achieve a satisfactory performance on both novel and base classes.

AUTHORS: JAVIER PÉREZ DE FRUTOS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.9, I.4.9; I.5.4; J.3; J.6]
HIGHLIGHT: Purpose: This study aims to explore training strategies to improve convolutional neural network-based image-to-image registration for abdominal imaging.

167, TITLE: Enhanced Artificial Intelligence-based Diagnosis Using CBCT with Internal Denoising: Clinical Validation for Discrimination of Fungal Ball, Sinusitis, and Normal Cases in The Maxillary Sinus
AUTHORS: Kyungsu Kim ; Chae Yeon Lim ; Joong Bo Shin ; Myung Jin Chung ; Yong Gi Jung
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, advanced AI-based diagnosis addressing intrinsic noise in CBCT has not been devised, discouraging the practical use of AI solutions for CBCT. To address this issue, we propose an AI-based computer-aided diagnosis method using CBCT with a denoising module.

168, TITLE: Segment-based Fusion of Multi-sensor Multi-scale Satellite Soil Moisture Retrievals
AUTHORS: Reza Attarzadeh ; Hossein Bagheri ; Iman Khosravi ; Saeid Niazmardi ; Davood Akbarid
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a segment-based image fusion framework to evaluate the possibility of preparing a multi-scale soil moisture map through integrated Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data.

169, TITLE: POLCOVID: A Multicenter Multiclass Chest X-ray Database (Poland, 2020-2021)
AUTHORS: ALEKSANDRA SUWALSKA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.6; I.4.9]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces POLCOVID dataset, containing chest X-ray (CXR) images of patients with COVID-19 or other-type pneumonia, and healthy individuals gathered from 15 Polish hospitals.

170, TITLE: Identification of Rare Cortical Folding Patterns Using Unsupervised Deep Learning
AUTHORS: LOUISE GUILLON et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a novel unsupervised deep learning approach to identify rare folding patterns and assess the degree of deviations that can be detected.

171, TITLE: COVID-19 Classification Using Deep Learning Two-Stage Approach
AUTHORS: Mostapha Alsaidi ; Ali Saleem Altaher ; Muhammad Tanveer Jan ; Ahmed Altaher ; Zahra Salekshahrezaee
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, deep-learning-based approaches namely fine-tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (VGG16 and VGG19), and end-to-end training of a developed CNN model, have been used in order to classify X-Ray images into four different classes that include COVID-19, normal, opacity and pneumonia cases.
