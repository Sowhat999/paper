HIGHLIGHT: Among other things, such explicit bounds typically allow the user to automatically prove sequence positivity (an active area of enumerative and algebraic combinatorics) by exhibiting an index when positive leading asymptotic behaviour dominates any error terms. In this article, we present a practical algorithm for computing such asymptotic approximations with rigorous error bounds, under the assumption that the generating series of the sequence is a solution of a differential equation with regular (Fuchsian) dominant singularities.

89, TITLE: ReVISE: Self-Supervised Speech Resynthesis with Visual Input for Universal and Generalized Speech Enhancement
AUTHORS: Wei-Ning Hsu ; Tal Remez ; Bowen Shi ; Jacob Donley ; Yossi Adi
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior works on improving speech quality with visual input typically study each type of auditory distortion separately (e.g., separation, inpainting, video-to-speech) and present tailored algorithms. This paper proposes to unify these subjects and study Generalized Speech Enhancement, where the goal is not to reconstruct the exact reference clean signal, but to focus on improving certain aspects of speech.

90, TITLE: Novel Deep Learning Framework For Bovine Iris Segmentation
AUTHORS: Heemoon Yoon ; Mira Park ; Sang-Hee Lee
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework for pixel-wise segmentation with minimum use of annotation labels using BovineAAEyes80 public dataset.

91, TITLE: Semi-supervised GAN for Bladder Tissue Classification in Multi-Domain Endoscopic Images
AUTHORS: JORGE F. LAZO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Method: We propose a semi-surprised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method composed of three main components: a teacher network trained on the labeled WLI data; a cycle-consistency GAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, and a multi-input student network.
