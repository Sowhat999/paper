We performed a human experiment (N = 62) with a mix of people who were and were not familiar with formal methods beforehand, asking them to validate whether a set of signal temporal logic (STL) constraints would keep an agent out of harm and allow it to complete a task in a gridworld capture-the-flag setting.

To close this gap, we present REASONX, an explanation tool based on Constraint Logic Programming (CLP).

AUTHORS: Kaishuai Xu ; Wenjun Hou ; Yi Cheng ; Jian Wang ; Wenjie Li
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous studies mainly addressed this by extracting the mentioned medical entities as critical dialogue history information. In this work, we argue that it is also essential to capture the transitions of the medical entities and the doctor's dialogue acts in each turn, as they help the understanding of how the dialogue flows and enhance the prediction of the entities and dialogue acts to be adopted in the following turn. Correspondingly, we propose a Dual Flow enhanced Medical (DFMed) dialogue generation framework.

Motivated by this, we propose a simple method to regularize the model from learning language invariant representations and a method to select model checkpoints without a development set in the target language, both resulting in better generation quality.

We present the semantic notion of agentivity as a case study for probing such interactions.

Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage stylization in performing feature-level adaptation by aligning the deep features extracted by the encoder of the network from the original and the stylized view of each input image with a novel feature invariance loss.

HIGHLIGHT: Although the efficiency of SNNs can be realized on the In-Memory Computing (IMC) architecture, we show that the energy cost and latency of SNNs scale linearly with the number of timesteps used on IMC hardware. Therefore, in order to maximize the efficiency of SNNs, we propose input-aware Dynamic Timestep SNN (DT-SNN), a novel algorithmic solution to dynamically determine the number of timesteps during inference on an input-dependent basis.
