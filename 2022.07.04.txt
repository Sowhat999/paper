HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel method to utilize \textbf{C}ounterfactual mechanism to generate artificial hard negative samples for \textbf{G}raph \textbf{C}ontrastive learning, namely \textbf{CGC}, which has a different perspective compared to those sampling-based strategies.

AUTHORS: Ashwin Ganesan
CATEGORY: cs.NI [cs.NI, cs.CC, cs.DM, cs.DS]
HIGHLIGHT: Motivated by recent results that the worst-case performance of the distributed maximal scheduling algorithm is characterized by the interference degree of the hypergraph, in the present work we investigate properties of the interference degree of the hypergraph and the structure of hypergraphs arising from physical constraints.

96, TITLE: SD-LayerNet: Semi-supervised Retinal Layer Segmentation in OCT Using Disentangled Representation with Anatomical Priors
AUTHORS: BOTOND FAZEKAS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the majority of state-of-the-art layer segmentation methods are based on purely supervised deep-learning, requiring a large amount of pixel-level annotated data that is expensive and hard to obtain. With this in mind, we introduce a semi-supervised paradigm into the retinal layer segmentation task that makes use of the information present in large-scale unlabeled datasets as well as anatomical priors.

AUTHORS: Zhuoxiao Li ; Haiyang Jiang ; Yinqiang Zheng

HIGHLIGHT: It is a challenge for traditional image processing pipelines owing to the fact that the physical constraints exerted implicitly in the channels are excessively complicated. To address this issue, we propose a learning-based approach to simultaneously restore clean signals and precise polarization information.
