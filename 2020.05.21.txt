HIGHLIGHT:      We propose BLEURT, a learned evaluation metric based on BERT that can model human judgments with a few thousand possibly biased training examples.

HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we detail the principles that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce the pipeline of it, through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users to achieve their customization purpose, and it's noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could achieve results with high fidelity and indeed indiscernible by mainstream forgery detection approaches.

HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce a variant of PCPs, that we refer to as rectangular PCPs, wherein proofs are thought of as square matrices, and the random coins used by the verifier can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, one determining the row of each query and the other determining the *column*.
