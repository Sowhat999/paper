88, TITLE: Towards Long-term Autonomy: A Perspective from Robot Learning
AUTHORS: Zhi Yan ; Li Sun ; Tomas Krajnik ; Tom Duckett ; Nicola Bellotto
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Today we believe that an important underpinning of long-term robot autonomy is the ability of robots to learn on site and on-the-fly, especially when they are deployed in changing environments or need to traverse different environments. In this paper, we examine the problem of long-term autonomy from the perspective of robot learning, especially in an online way, and discuss in tandem its premise "data" and the subsequent "deployment".

89, TITLE: GraffMatch: Global Matching of 3D Lines and Planes for Wide Baseline LiDAR Registration
AUTHORS: Parker C. Lusk ; Devarth Parikh ; Jonathan P. How
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Global landmark matching has been investigated in the literature, but these methods typically use ad hoc representations of 3D line and plane landmarks that are not invariant to large viewpoint changes, resulting in incorrect matches and high registration error. To address this issue, we adopt the affine Grassmannian manifold to represent 3D lines and planes and prove that the distance between two landmarks is invariant to rotation and translation if a shift operation is performed before applying the Grassmannian metric.

91, TITLE: Development of A Thermodynamics of Human Cognition and Human Culture
AUTHORS: Diederik Aerts ; Jonito Aerts ArguÃ«lles ; Lester Beltran ; Sandro Sozzo
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.CL, quant-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: This result can be prolonged to human culture and its collaborative entities having lower entropy than their constituent elements. We use these findings to propose the development of a new 'non-classical thermodynamic theory for human cognition and human culture', which bridges concepts and quantum entities and agrees with some recent findings on the conceptual, not physical, nature of quantum entities.

HIGHLIGHT: We used a liquid state machine and a logistic regression classifier to construct a spiking neural network for classifying 15 sitting postures. To allow this system to read our pressure data into the spiking neurons, we designed an algorithm to encode map-like data into cosine-rank sparsity data.
