http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11794
AUTHORS:        Yujie Zhong ; Relja Arandjelović ; Andrew Zisserman
COMMENTS:       20 pages
HIGHLIGHT:      The objective of this work is to learn a compact embedding of a set of descriptors that is suitable for efficient retrieval and ranking, whilst maintaining discriminability of the individual descriptors. Here the set consists of the face descriptors in each image, and given a query for multiple identities, the goal is then to retrieve, in order, images which contain all the identities, all but one, \etc To this end, we make the following contributions: first, we propose a CNN architecture -- {\em SetNet} -- to achieve the objective: it learns face descriptors and their aggregation over a set to produce a compact fixed length descriptor designed for set retrieval, and the score of an image is a count of the number of identities that match the query; second, we show that this compact descriptor has minimal loss of discriminability up to two faces per image, and degrades slowly after that -- far exceeding a number of baselines; third, we explore the speed vs.\ retrieval quality trade-off for set retrieval using this compact descriptor; and, finally, we collect and annotate a large dataset of images containing various number of celebrities, which we use for evaluation and is publicly released.
