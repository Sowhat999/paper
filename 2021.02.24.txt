90, TITLE: On Sexual Selection
AUTHORS: Larry Bull
CATEGORY: q-bio.PE [q-bio.PE, cs.NE]

AUTHORS: YEMAN BRHANE HAGOS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To minimize the effect of cell imbalance on cell detection, we proposed a deep learning pipeline that considers the abundance of cell types during model training.

97, TITLE: Histo-fetch -- On-the-fly Processing of Gigapixel Whole Slide Images Simplifies and Speeds Neural Network Training
AUTHORS: Brendon Lutnick ; Leema Krishna Murali ; Brandon Ginley ; Pinaki Sarder
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We created a custom pipeline (histo-fetch) to efficiently extract random patches and labels from pathology whole slide images (WSIs) for input to a neural network on-the-fly.

98, TITLE: VisualCheXbert: Addressing The Discrepancy Between Radiology Report Labels and Image Labels
AUTHORS: SAAHIL JAIN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we show that radiologists labeling reports significantly disagree with radiologists labeling corresponding chest X-ray images, which reduces the quality of report labels as proxies for image labels.
