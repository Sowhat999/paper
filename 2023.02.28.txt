85, TITLE: Dirichlet-based Uncertainty Calibration for Active Domain Adaptation
AUTHORS: Mixue Xie ; Shuang Li ; Rui Zhang ; Chi Harold Liu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite active DA methods address this by further proposing targetness to measure the representativeness of target domain characteristics, their predictive uncertainty is usually based on the prediction of deterministic models, which can easily be miscalibrated on data with distribution shift. Considering this, we propose a \textit{Dirichlet-based Uncertainty Calibration} (DUC) approach for active DA, which simultaneously achieves the mitigation of miscalibration and the selection of informative target samples.

AUTHORS: Kaijie He ; Canlong Zhang ; Sheng Xie ; Zhixin Li ; Zhiwen Wang

To alleviate the above problem, we propose a long-term context attention (LCA) module that can perform extensive information fusion on the target and its context from long-term frames, and calculate the target correlation while enhancing target features.

HIGHLIGHT: Existing studies of multi-label federated learning did not consider the characteristics of multi-label data, i.e., they used the concept of multi-class classification to verify their methods' performance, which means it will not be feasible to apply their methods to real-world applications. Therefore, this study proposed a new multi-label federated learning framework with a Clustering-based Multi-label Data Allocation (CMDA) and a novel aggregation method, Fast Label-Adaptive Aggregation (FLAG), for multi-label classification in the federated learning environment.

CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Inspired by stereo vision, in this paper, we develop X-ray imaging methods that work with two X-ray projection images.

244, TITLE: Robust Cross-domain CT Image Reconstruction Via Bayesian Noise Uncertainty Alignment
AUTHORS: Kecheng Chen ; Haoliang Li ; Renjie Wan ; Hong Yan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we tackle the problem of robust computed tomography (CT) reconstruction issue under a cross-domain scenario, i.e., the training CT data as the source domain and the testing CT data as the target domain are collected from different anatomical regions.

245, TITLE: Deep Learning-based Multi-Organ CT Segmentation with Adversarial Data Augmentation
AUTHORS: SHAOYAN PAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose an adversarial attack-based data augmentation method to improve the deep-learning-based segmentation algorithm for the delineation of Organs-At-Risk (OAR) in abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) to facilitate radiation therapy.

246, TITLE: Automatic Classification of Symmetry of Hemithoraces in Canine and Feline Radiographs
AUTHORS: Peyman Tahghighi ; Nicole Norena ; Eran Ukwatta ; Ryan B Appleby ; Amin Komeili
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Asymmetrical hemithoraces are one of the indications of obliquity for which we propose an automatic classification method.

247, TITLE: MDF-Net: Multimodal Dual-Fusion Network for Abnormality Detection Using CXR Images and Clinical Data
AUTHORS: CHIHCHENG HSIEH et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a novel architecture consisting of two fusion methods that enable the model to simultaneously process patients' clinical data (structured data) and chest X-rays (image data).
