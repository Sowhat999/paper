102, TITLE: TargetCall: Eliminating The Wasted Computation in Basecalling Via Pre-Basecalling Filtering
AUTHORS: MERYEM BANU CAVLAK et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no match the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are discarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling computation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first fast and widely-applicable pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling.
