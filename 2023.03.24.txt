Therefore, instead of focusing on the worst-case risk minimization, we propose SharpDRO by penalizing the sharpness of the worst-case distribution, which measures the loss changes around the neighbor of learning parameters.

We decompose the KD loss and find the non-target loss from it forces the student's non-target logits to match the teacher's, but the sum of the two non-target logits is different, preventing them from being identical.

120, TITLE: SINE: Semantic-driven Image-based NeRF Editing with Prior-guided Editing Field
AUTHORS: CHONG BAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the great success in 2D editing using user-friendly tools, such as Photoshop, semantic strokes, or even text prompts, similar capabilities in 3D areas are still limited, either relying on 3D modeling skills or allowing editing within only a few categories.In this paper, we present a novel semantic-driven NeRF editing approach, which enables users to edit a neural radiance field with a single image, and faithfully delivers edited novel views with high fidelity and multi-view consistency.To achieve this goal, we propose a prior-guided editing field to encode fine-grained geometric and texture editing in 3D space, and develop a series of techniques to aid the editing process, including cyclic constraints with a proxy mesh to facilitate geometric supervision, a color compositing mechanism to stabilize semantic-driven texture editing, and a feature-cluster-based regularization to preserve the irrelevant content unchanged.Extensive experiments and editing examples on both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that our method achieves photo-realistic 3D editing using only a single edited image, pushing the bound of semantic-driven editing in 3D real-world scenes.

159, TITLE: Reinforcement Learning with Exogenous States and Rewards
AUTHORS: George Trimponias ; Thomas G. Dietterich
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: We study settings where the decomposition of the state space into exogenous and endogenous state spaces is not given but must be discovered. The paper introduces and proves correctness of algorithms for discovering the exogenous and endogenous subspaces of the state space when they are mixed through linear combination.

160, TITLE: Variantional Autoencoder with Decremental Information Bottleneck for Disentanglement
AUTHORS: JIANTAO WU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, a large bottleneck will lose the constraint of disentanglement, causing the information diffusion problem. To tackle this issue, we present a novel decremental variational autoencoder with disentanglement-invariant transformations to optimize multiple objectives in different layers, termed DeVAE, for balancing disentanglement and reconstruction fidelity by decreasing the information bottleneck of diverse latent spaces gradually.

161, TITLE: Preference-Aware Constrained Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization
AUTHORS: Alaleh Ahmadianshalchi ; Syrine Belakaria ; Janardhan Rao Doppa
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, math.OC, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: The key challenges include the huge size of the design space, multiple objectives and large number of constraints, and the small fraction of feasible input designs which can be identified only after performing expensive simulations. We propose a novel and efficient preference-aware constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization approach referred to as PAC-MOO to address these challenges.

162, TITLE: Continuous Indeterminate Probability Neural Network

163, TITLE: The Shaky Foundations of Clinical Foundation Models: A Survey of Large Language Models and Foundation Models for EMRs
AUTHORS: MICHAEL WORNOW et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We find that most models are trained on small, narrowly-scoped clinical datasets (e.g. MIMIC-III) or broad, public biomedical corpora (e.g. PubMed) and are evaluated on tasks that do not provide meaningful insights on their usefulness to health systems. In light of these findings, we propose an improved evaluation framework for measuring the benefits of clinical foundation models that is more closely grounded to metrics that matter in healthcare.

AUTHORS: HAIJIN ZENG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While deep learning methods have shown promise in this area, they still suffer from several challenges, including limited modeling of non-local dependencies, lack of consideration of the periodic MSFA pattern that could be linked to periodic artifacts, and difficulty in recovering high-frequency details.
