By noticing the term importance weight can provide valuable information for passage retrieval, we hereby propose alternative retrieval oriented masking (dubbed as ROM) strategy where more important tokens will have a higher probability of being masked out, to capture this straightforward yet essential information to facilitate the language model pre-training process.

164, TITLE: A Teacher-student Framework for Unsupervised Speech Enhancement Using Noise Remixing Training and Two-stage Inference
AUTHORS: Li-Wei Chen ; Yao-Fei Cheng ; Hung-Shin Lee ; Yu Tsao ; Hsin-Min Wang
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.MM, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: The lack of clean speech is a practical challenge to the development of speech enhancement systems, which means that the training of neural network models must be done in an unsupervised manner, and there is an inevitable mismatch between their training criterion and evaluation metric. In response to this unfavorable situation, we propose a teacher-student training strategy that does not require any subjective/objective speech quality metrics as learning reference by improving the previously proposed noisy-target training (NyTT).
