50, TITLE:      Social Bias Frames: Reasoning about Social and Power Implications of Language
http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03891
AUTHORS:        Maarten Sap ; Saadia Gabriel ; Lianhui Qin ; Dan Jurafsky ; Noah A. Smith ; Yejin Choi
COMMENTS:       ACL 2020 Camera Ready; Data available at http://tinyurl.com/social-bias-frames
HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups.
