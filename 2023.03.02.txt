38, TITLE: P$^2$SDF for Neural Indoor Scene Reconstruction
AUTHORS: JING LI et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: However, as the nature of per-scene optimization is based on the volumetric rendering of color, previous neural implicit surface reconstruction methods usually fail in low-textured regions, including the floors, walls, etc., which commonly exist for indoor scenes. Being aware of the fact that these low-textured regions usually correspond to planes, without introducing additional ground-truth supervisory signals or making additional assumptions about the room layout, we propose to leverage a novel Pseudo Plane-regularized Signed Distance Field (P$^2$SDF) for indoor scene reconstruction.
