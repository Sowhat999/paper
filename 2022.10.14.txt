AUTHORS: Kevin Yang ; Nanyun Peng ; Yuandong Tian ; Dan Klein
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]

AUTHORS: Yongjing Yin ; Yafu Li ; Fandong Meng ; Jie Zhou ; Yue Zhang

We address this issue by introducing categorization to the source contextualized representations.

78, TITLE: H2RBox: Horizonal Box Annotation Is All You Need for Oriented Object Detection
AUTHORS: XUE YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Oriented object detection emerges in many applications from aerial images to autonomous driving, while many existing detection benchmarks are annotated with horizontal bounding box only which is also less costive than fine-grained rotated box, leading to a gap between the readily available training corpus and the rising demand for oriented object detection. This paper proposes a simple yet effective oriented object detection approach called H2RBox merely using horizontal box annotation for weakly-supervised training, which closes the above gap and shows competitive performance even against those trained with rotated boxes.

85, TITLE: U-HRNet: Delving Into Improving Semantic Representation of High Resolution Network for Dense Prediction
AUTHORS: JIAN WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, we believe that the lowest-resolution feature map often contains the strongest semantic information, and it is necessary to go through more layers to merge with high-resolution feature maps, while for high-resolution feature maps, the computational cost of each convolutional layer is very large, and there is no need to go through so many layers. Therefore, we designed a U-shaped High-Resolution Network (U-HRNet), which adds more stages after the feature map with strongest semantic representation and relaxes the constraint in HRNet that all resolutions need to be calculated parallel for a newly added stage.

We propose to address the background shift with a novel classifier initialization method which employs gradient-based attribution to identify the most relevant weights for new classes from the classifier's weights for the previous background and transfers these weights to the new classifier.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, an agent has access to two sets of trajectories: labelled trajectories containing state, action, reward triplets at every timestep, along with unlabelled trajectories that contain only state and reward information. For this setting, we develop a simple meta-algorithmic pipeline that learns an inverse-dynamics model on the labelled data to obtain proxy-labels for the unlabelled data, followed by the use of any offline RL algorithm on the true and proxy-labelled trajectories.

170, TITLE: Learning Physical Dynamics with Subequivariant Graph Neural Networks
AUTHORS: JIAQI HAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: 2) Objects in the physical world possess diverse shapes, sizes, and properties, which should be appropriately processed by the model. To tackle these difficulties, we propose a novel backbone, Subequivariant Graph Neural Network, which 1) relaxes equivariance to subequivariance by considering external fields like gravity, where the universal approximation ability holds theoretically; 2) introduces a new subequivariant object-aware message passing for learning physical interactions between multiple objects of various shapes in the particle-based representation; 3) operates in a hierarchical fashion, allowing for modeling long-range and complex interactions.

181, TITLE: Sample-Then-Optimize Batch Neural Thompson Sampling
AUTHORS: Zhongxiang Dai ; Yao Shu ; Bryan Kian Hsiang Low ; Patrick Jaillet
