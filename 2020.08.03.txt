http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15036
AUTHORS:        Joseph W. Cutler ; Daniel R. Licata ; Norman Danner
COMMENTS:       To appear in ICFP 2020; formatting changes
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we extend these techniques to support amortized analysis, where costs are rearranged from one portion of a program to another to achieve more precise bounds.

52, TITLE:      NoiseBreaker: Gradual Image Denoising Guided by Noise Analysis
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07487
AUTHORS:        Florian Lemarchand ; Erwan Nogues ; Maxime Pelcat
COMMENTS:       ACCEPTED by MMSP20
HIGHLIGHT:      This paper proposes a gradual denoising strategy that iteratively detects the dominating noise in an image, and removes it using a tailored denoiser.

53, TITLE:      A Differentiable Recurrent Surface for Asynchronous Event-Based Data
http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03455
AUTHORS:        Marco Cannici ; Marco Ciccone ; Andrea Romanoni ; Matteo Matteucci
COMMENTS:       23 pages, 6 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose Matrix-LSTM, a grid of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells that efficiently process events and learn end-to-end task-dependent event-surfaces.

54, TITLE:      Semantic Segmentation of Underwater Imagery: Dataset and Benchmark
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01241
AUTHORS:        Md Jahidul Islam ; Chelsey Edge ; Yuyang Xiao ; Peigen Luo ; Muntaqim Mehtaz ; Christopher Morse ; Sadman Sakib Enan ; Junaed Sattar
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we present the first large-scale dataset for semantic Segmentation of Underwater IMagery (SUIM).

55, TITLE:      On P Versus NP
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00809
AUTHORS:        Lev Gordeev
COMMENTS:       It is an extension of arXiv.org/pdf/2005.00809.pdf by new references and comments
HIGHLIGHT:      I generalize a well-known result that P = NP fails for monotone polynomial circuits - more precisely, that the clique problem CLIQUE(k^4,k) is not solvable by Boolean (AND,OR)-circuits of the size polynomial in k.

56, TITLE:      Deformation-Aware 3D Model Embedding and Retrieval
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01228
AUTHORS:        Mikaela Angelina Uy ; Jingwei Huang ; Minhyuk Sung ; Tolga Birdal ; Leonidas Guibas
COMMENTS:       Accepted for publication at ECCV 2020. Project page under https://deformscan2cad.github.io
HIGHLIGHT:      Thus, to retrieve the best models for fitting, we propose a novel deep embedding approach that learns the asymmetric relationships by leveraging location-dependent egocentric distance fields. We introduce a new problem of retrieving 3D models that are deformable to a given query shape and present a novel deep deformation-aware embedding to solve this retrieval task.

57, TITLE:      Project RISE: Recognizing Industrial Smoke Emissions
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06111
AUTHORS:        Yen-Chia Hsu ; Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang ; Ting-Yao Hu ; Paul Dille ; Sean Prendi ; Ryan Hoffman ; Anastasia Tsuhlares ; Randy Sargent ; Illah Nourbakhsh
COMMENTS:       Technical report
HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce RISE, the first large-scale video dataset for Recognizing Industrial Smoke Emissions.

58, TITLE:      Temporal Aggregate Representations for Long-Range Video Understanding
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00830
AUTHORS:        Fadime Sener ; Dipika Singhania ; Angela Yao
COMMENTS:       ECCV 2020, European Conference on Computer Vision
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we address questions of temporal extent, scaling, and level of semantic abstraction with a flexible multi-granular temporal aggregation framework.

59, TITLE:      A SUPER* Algorithm to Optimize Paper Bidding in Peer Review
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07079
AUTHORS:        Tanner Fiez ; Nihar B. Shah ; Lillian Ratliff
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we begin by developing a framework to study this problem in a principled manner.

60, TITLE:      Manipulation Motion Taxonomy and Coding for Robots
http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00532
AUTHORS:        David Paulius ; Yongqiang Huang ; Jason Meloncon ; Yu Sun
COMMENTS:       IROS 2019 Submission -- 6 pages
HIGHLIGHT:      This paper introduces a taxonomy of manipulations as seen especially in cooking for 1) grouping manipulations from the robotics point of view, 2) consolidating aliases and removing ambiguity for motion types, and 3) provide a path to transferring learned manipulations to new unlearned manipulations.
