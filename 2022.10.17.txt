AUTHORS: Swaroop Mishra ; Anjana Arunkumar ; Chris Bryan ; Chitta Baral
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.CV]

We propose a method based on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) for this task; we validate our method by showing that existing models are more accurate with respect to the easier sample-chunks than with respect to the harder sample-chunks.

AUTHORS: Xiangqing Shen ; Siwei Wu ; Rui Xia
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The one-hop annotation manner made ATOMIC a set of independent bipartite graphs, which ignored the numerous missing links between events in different bipartite graphs and consequently caused shortcomings in knowledge coverage and multi-hop reasoning. To address these issues, we propose a CSKG completion approach by training a relation prediction model based on a set of existing triplets, and infer the missing links on ATOMIC.

HIGHLIGHT: Recent advances in EL utilize dense retrieval approaches for Candidate Generation, which addresses some of the shortcomings of the Lookup based approach of matching NER mentions against pre-computed dictionaries. In this work, we show that in the domain of Tweets, such methods suffer as users often include informal spelling, limited context, and lack of specificity, among other issues.

AUTHORS: Shirley Anugrah Hayati ; Kyumin Park ; Dheeraj Rajagopal ; Lyle Ungar ; Dongyeop Kang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This incorrect word importance learned by the model often leads to ambiguous token-level explanations which do not align with human perception of linguistic styles. To tackle this challenge, we introduce StyLEx, a model that learns annotated human perceptions of stylistic lexica and uses these stylistic words as additional information for predicting the style of a sentence.

41, TITLE: Transparency Helps Reveal When Language Models Learn Meaning
AUTHORS: Zhaofeng Wu ; William Merrill ; Hao Peng ; Iz Beltagy ; Noah A. Smith
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

AUTHORS: Mojtaba Valipour ; Mehdi Rezagholizadeh ; Ivan Kobyzev ; Ali Ghodsi
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While LoRA blocks are parameter efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together.
