COMMENTS:       Accepted at NLP4ConvAI Workshop at ACL2020
HIGHLIGHT:      To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel method to incorporate the contextual information in two different levels, i.e., representation level and task-specific (i.e., label) level.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14405
AUTHORS:        Komal Chugh ; Parul Gupta ; Abhinav Dhall ; Ramanathan Subramanian
HIGHLIGHT:      We propose detection of deepfake videos based on the dissimilarity between the audio and visual modalities, termed as the Modality Dissonance Score (MDS).

AUTHORS:        Paolo Pagliuca ; Nicola Milano ; Stefano Nolfi
COMMENTS:       17 pages, 5 Figures, 4 Tables
HIGHLIGHT:      We analyze the efficacy of modern neuro-evolutionary strategies for continuous control optimization.

86, TITLE:      Practical Sized Typing for Coq
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05601
AUTHORS:        Jonathan Chan ; William J. Bowman
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we present a design and implementation of sized type checking and inference for Coq.

87, TITLE:      On Value Functions and the Agent-Environment Boundary
http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13341
AUTHORS:        Nan Jiang
COMMENTS:       16 pages
HIGHLIGHT:      We address this issue via a simple and novel boundary-invariant analysis of Fitted Q-Iteration, a representative RL algorithm, where the assumptions and the guarantees are invariant to the choice of boundary.

88, TITLE:      Dice: Compiling Discrete Probabilistic Programs for Scalable Inference
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09089
AUTHORS:        Steven Holtzen ; Guy Van den Broeck ; Todd Millstein
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we target scalable inference for an important class of probabilistic programs: those whose probability distributions are discrete.

89, TITLE:      The State and Fate of Linguistic Diversity and Inclusion in the NLP World
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09095
AUTHORS:        Pratik Joshi ; Sebastin Santy ; Amar Budhiraja ; Kalika Bali ; Monojit Choudhury
COMMENTS:       Accepted at ACL 2020 (10 pages + 2 pages Appendix). P.J., S.S. and A.B. contributed equally
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper we look at the relation between the types of languages, resources, and their representation in NLP conferences to understand the trajectory that different languages have followed over time.

90, TITLE:      Cascaded Refinement Network for Point Cloud Completion
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03327
AUTHORS:        Xiaogang Wang ; Marcelo H Ang Jr ; Gim Hee Lee
COMMENTS:       CVPR2020
HIGHLIGHT:      To this end, we propose a cascaded refinement network together with a coarse-to-fine strategy to synthesize the detailed object shapes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03354
AUTHORS:        Nina Poerner ; Ulli Waltinger ; Hinrich Schütze
HIGHLIGHT:      We cover over 50% of the BioBERT-BERT F1 delta, at 5% of BioBERT's CO_2 footprint and 2% of its cloud compute cost.

92, TITLE:      Learning Representative Temporal Features for Action Recognition
http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06724
