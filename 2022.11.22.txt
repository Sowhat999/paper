17, TITLE: Metaphorical Language Change Is Self-Organized Criticality
AUTHORS: Xuri Tang ; Huifang Ye
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, nlin.AO]

49, TITLE: Embracing Ambiguity: Improving Similarity-oriented Tasks with Contextual Synonym Knowledge
AUTHORS: YANGNING LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing works which inject synonym knowledge into PLMs often suffer from two severe problems: (i) Neglecting the ambiguity of synonyms, and (ii) Undermining semantic understanding of original PLMs, which is caused by inconsistency between the exact semantic similarity of the synonyms and the broad conceptual relevance learned from the original corpus. To address these issues, we propose PICSO, a flexible framework that supports the injection of contextual synonym knowledge from multiple domains into PLMs via a novel entity-aware Adapter which focuses on the semantics of the entities (synonyms) in the contexts.

To address these problems, we propose a DreamArtist method that employs a learning strategy of contrastive prompt-tuning, which introduces both positive and negative embeddings as pseudo-words and trains them jointly.

To overcome these limitations, we propose an Auto-Focus Contrastive Learning (AF-CL) network for image manipulation detection.

152, TITLE: Plug and Play Active Learning for Object Detection
AUTHORS: Chenhongyi Yang ; Lichao Huang ; Elliot J. Crowley

We propose a two-stage active learning algorithm Plug and Play Active Learning (PPAL) that overcomes these difficulties.

177, TITLE: STGlow: A Flow-based Generative Framework with Dual Graphormer for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction
AUTHORS: Rongqin Liang ; Yuanman Li ; Jiantao Zhou ; Xia Li
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, GAN-based methods do not directly model data in a latent space, which makes them fail to have full support over the underlying data distribution; CVAE-based methods optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood of observations, causing the learned distribution to deviate from the underlying distribution. The above limitations make existing approaches often generate highly biased or unnatural trajectories.In this paper, we propose a novel generative flow based framework with dual graphormer for pedestrian trajectory prediction (STGlow).

To tackle these limitations of Masked Video Modeling, we propose a new token selection method that masks our more important tokens according to the object's motions in an online manner, which we refer to as Motion-centric Token Selection.

266, TITLE: Data-Driven Offline Decision-Making Via Invariant Representation Learning
AUTHORS: Han Qi ; Yi Su ; Aviral Kumar ; Sergey Levine
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: A key challenge in all these settings is distributional shift: when we optimize with respect to the input into a model trained from offline data, it is easy to produce an out-of-distribution (OOD) input that appears erroneously good. In contrast to prior approaches that utilize pessimism or conservatism to tackle this problem, in this paper, we formulate offline data-driven decision-making as domain adaptation, where the goal is to make accurate predictions for the value of optimized decisions ("target domain"), when training only on the dataset ("source domain").

286, TITLE: Debiasing Meta-Gradient Reinforcement Learning By Learning The Outer Value Function
AUTHORS: Clément Bonnet ; Laurence Midgley ; Alexandre Laterre
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Because the meta-learned discount factor is typically lower than the one used in the outer objective, the resulting bias can cause the meta-gradient to favor myopic policies. We propose a simple solution to this issue: we eliminate this bias by using an alternative, \emph{outer} value function in the estimation of the outer loss.

In this work, we demonstrate how this class of methods can benefit from large-batch optimization, which is commonly overlooked by the deep offline RL community.

HIGHLIGHT: To compensate this gap,many extraordinary works have been proposed.Nevertheless,these works are mainly based on the same kind of network structure (i.e.CNN) and their performance is worse than their ANN counterparts,which limits the applications of SNNs.To this end,we propose a novel Transformer-based SNN,termed "Spikeformer",which outperforms its ANN counterpart on both static dataset and neuromorphic dataset and may be an alternative architecture to CNN for training high-performance SNNs.First,to deal with the problem of "data hungry" and the unstable training period exhibited in the vanilla model,we design the Convolutional Tokenizer (CT) module,which improves the accuracy of the original model on DVS-Gesture by more than 16%.

We overcome these limitations and present a general object reorientation controller that is trained using reinforcement learning in simulation and evaluated in the real world.

322, TITLE: LA-VocE: Low-SNR Audio-visual Speech Enhancement Using Neural Vocoders
AUTHORS: RODRIGO MIRA et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Despite recent advances in speech synthesis, most audio-visual approaches continue to use spectral mapping/masking to reproduce the clean audio, often resulting in visual backbones added to existing speech enhancement architectures. In this work, we propose LA-VocE, a new two-stage approach that predicts mel-spectrograms from noisy audio-visual speech via a transformer-based architecture, and then converts them into waveform audio using a neural vocoder (HiFi-GAN).
