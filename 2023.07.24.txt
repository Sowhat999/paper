HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel benchmark of \underline{S}cene \underline{K}nowledge-guided \underline{V}isual \underline{G}rounding (SK-VG), where the image content and referring expressions are not sufficient to ground the target objects, forcing the models to have a reasoning ability on the long-form scene knowledge. To perform this task, we propose two approaches to accept the triple-type input, where the former embeds knowledge into the image features before the image-query interaction; the latter leverages linguistic structure to assist in computing the image-text matching.
