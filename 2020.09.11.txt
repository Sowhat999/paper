HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we build on this observation and extend it to a `vector space semantics' for the \emph{general} Lambek calculus, based on \emph{algebras over a field} $\mathbb{K}$ (or $\mathbb{K}$-algebras), i.e. vector spaces endowed with a bilinear binary product.

HIGHLIGHT:      We here present our solution, based on introducing an auxiliary operator $pri(E)$ defining a "priority scope", to the long time open problem of axiomatizing priority using standard observational congruence: we provide a complete axiomatization for a basic process algebra with priority and (unguarded) recursion.
