CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 94A08, I.4.7]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an FR-IQA model with the quadratic sum of the GM and the LOG signals, which obtains good performance in image quality estimation considering shift-insensitive property for not well-registered reference and distortion image pairs.

180, TITLE: Atlas-ISTN: Joint Segmentation, Registration And Atlas Construction With Image-and-Spatial Transformer Networks
AUTHORS: MATTHEW SINCLAIR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose Atlas-ISTN, a framework that jointly learns segmentation and registration on 2D and 3D image data, and constructs a population-derived atlas in the process.

181, TITLE: CCML: A Novel Collaborative Learning Model For Classification Of Remote Sensing Images With Noisy Multi-Labels
AUTHORS: Ahmet Kerem Aksoy ; Mahdyar Ravanbakhsh ; Tristan Kreuziger ; Begum Demir
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this problem, we propose a novel Consensual Collaborative Multi-Label Learning (CCML) method to alleviate the adverse effects of multi-label noise during the training phase of the CNN model.

182, TITLE: MA-Unet: An Improved Version Of Unet Based On Multi-scale And Attention Mechanism For Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Yutong Cai ; Yong Wang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we try to eliminate semantic ambiguity in skip connection operations by adding attention gates (AGs), and use attention mechanisms to combine local features with their corresponding global dependencies, explicitly model the dependencies between channels and use multi-scale predictive fusion to utilize global information at different scales.
