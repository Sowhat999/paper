HIGHLIGHT: To achieve this, we propose a new framework called Adaptive UNet where each convolutional block is equipped with an adaptive batch normalization layer to adapt the features with respect to a domain code.

90, TITLE: Detection of Multiple Retinal Diseases in Ultra-widefield Fundus Images Using Deep Learning: Data-driven Identification of Relevant Regions
AUTHORS: JUSTIN ENGELMANN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: Our model performs very well, separating between healthy and diseased retinas with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9206 on an internal test set, and an AUC of 0.9841 on a challenging, external test set.

91, TITLE: Flexible Amortized Variational Inference in QBOLD MRI
AUTHORS: IVOR J. A. SIMPSON et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: This work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can infer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV.

92, TITLE: Video Coding for Machines with Feature-Based Rate-Distortion Optimization
AUTHORS: Kristian Fischer ; Fabian Brand ; Christian Herglotz ; André Kaup
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.2]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a standard-compliant feature-based RDO (FRDO) that is designed to increase the coding performance, when the decoded frame is analyzed by a neural network in a video coding for machine scenario.

93, TITLE: AI-enabled Automatic Multimodal Fusion of Cone-Beam CT and Intraoral Scans for Intelligent 3D Tooth-Bone Reconstruction and Clinical Applications
AUTHORS: JIN HAO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we present a Deep Dental Multimodal Analysis (DDMA) framework consisting of a CBCT segmentation model, an intraoral scan (IOS) segmentation model (the most accurate digital dental model), and a fusion model to generate 3D fused crown-root-bone structures with high fidelity and accurate occlusal and dentition information.

94, TITLE: Evaluating U-net Brain Extraction for Multi-site and Longitudinal Preclinical Stroke Imaging
AUTHORS: ERENDIZ TARAKCI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: We describe the design and development of this system, and report our findings linking data characteristics to segmentation performance.
