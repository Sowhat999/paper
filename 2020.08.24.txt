CATEGORY:       cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]

CATEGORY:       cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]

39, TITLE:      Expressing Diverse Human Driving Behavior with Probabilistic Rewards and Online Inference
http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08812
AUTHORS:        Liting Sun ; Zheng Wu ; Hengbo Ma ; Masayoshi Tomizuka
COMMENTS:       7 pages, 9 figures, 2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)
CATEGORY:       cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:      Most of traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms, however, cannot adequately capture the diversity of human behavior since they assume that all behavior in a given dataset is generated by a single cost function.In this paper, we propose a probabilistic IRL framework that directly learns a distribution of cost functions in continuous domain.
