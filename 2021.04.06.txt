180, TITLE: Opportunistic Screening of Osteoporosis Using Plain Film Chest X-ray
AUTHORS: FAKAI WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a method to predict BMD from Chest X-ray (CXR), one of the most common, accessible, and low-cost medical image examinations.

181, TITLE: Adaptive Gradient Balancing for UndersampledMRI Reconstruction and Image-to-Image Translation
AUTHORS: ITZIK MALKIEL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we enhance the image quality by using a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network combined with a novel Adaptive Gradient Balancing (AGB) technique that automates the process of combining the adversarial and pixel-wise terms and streamlines hyperparameter tuning.
