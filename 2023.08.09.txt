We hypothesize that integrating such constraints on the activations of a DNN would improve its adversarial robustness, and, to test this hypothesis, we have developed the Self-Consistent Activation (SCA) layer, which comprises of neurons whose activations are consistent with each other, as they conform to a fixed, but learned, covariability pattern.
