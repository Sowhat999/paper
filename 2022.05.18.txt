HIGHLIGHT: Second, most systems only provide fixed built-in endpoints and cannot be customised to satisfy various research requirements. To this end, we develop a robust and endpoint extensible ADMET system, HelixADMET (H-ADMET).

88, TITLE: A Unified Framework for Dataset Shift Diagnostics
AUTHORS: Felipe Maia Polo ; Rafael Izbicki ; Evanildo Gomes Lacerda Jr ; Juan Pablo Ibieta-Jimenez ; Renato Vicente
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ME]
HIGHLIGHT: Unfortunately, current methods for detecting shift are only designed to detect specific types of shift or cannot formally test their presence. We introduce a general framework that gives insights on how to improve prediction methods by detecting the presence of different types of shift and quantifying how strong they are.

89, TITLE: Application of Graph Based Features in Computer Aided Diagnosis for Histopathological Image Classification of Gastric Cancer
AUTHORS: HAIQING ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, based on the study of computer aided diagnosis system, graph based features are applied to gastric cancer histopathology microscopic image analysis, and a classifier is used to classify gastric cancer cells from benign cells.

90, TITLE: Using Artificial Intelligence to Detect Chest X-rays with No Significant Findings in A Primary Health Care Setting in Oulu, Finland
AUTHORS: Tommi Keski-Filppula ; Marko Nikki ; Marianne Haapea ; Naglis Ramanauskas ; Osmo Tervonen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: Objectives: To assess the use of artificial intelligence-based software in ruling out chest X-ray cases, with no significant findings in a primary health care setting. Methods: In this retrospective study, a commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) software was used to analyse 10 000 chest X-rays of Finnish primary health care patients.

91, TITLE: Brachial Plexus Nerve Trunk Segmentation Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study with Doctors' Manual Segmentation
AUTHORS: YU WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we establish a public dataset containing 320 ultrasound images of brachial plexus (BP).

92, TITLE: CAS-Net: Conditional Atlas Generation and Brain Segmentation for Fetal MRI
AUTHORS: LIU LI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel network structure that can simultaneously generate conditional atlases and predict brain tissue segmentation, called CAS-Net.

93, TITLE: HoVer-Trans: Anatomy-aware HoVer-Transformer for ROI-free Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Ultrasound Images
AUTHORS: YUHAO MO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose a novel ROI-free model for breast cancer diagnosis in ultrasound images with interpretable feature representations.

94, TITLE: Computerized Tomography Pulmonary Angiography Image Simulation Using Cycle Generative Adversarial Network from Chest CT Imaging in Pulmonary Embolism Patients
AUTHORS: Chia-Hung Yang ; Yun-Chien Cheng ; Chin Kuo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The purpose of this research is to develop a system that generates simulated computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) images clinically for pulmonary embolism diagnoses.

95, TITLE: A Framework for CSI-Based Indoor Localization with 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Liping Wang ; Sudeep Pasricha
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, CSI signal patterns can be complicated in the large and highly dynamic indoor spaces with complex interiors, thus a solution for solving this issue is urgently needed to expand the applications of CSI to a broader indoor space. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution including data collection, pattern clustering, denoising, calibration and a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) model with CSI fingerprinting to tackle this problem.

96, TITLE: Multi-Head Attention Neural Network for Smartphone Invariant Indoor Localization
AUTHORS: Saideep Tiku ; Danish Gufran ; Sudeep Pasricha
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a multi-head attention neural network-based indoor localization framework that is resilient to device heterogeneity.
