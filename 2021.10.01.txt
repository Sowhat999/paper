96, TITLE:	Modeling
 Interactions of Autonomous Vehicles and Pedestrians with Deep 
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Collision Avoidance
AUTHORS:	Raphael Trumpp ; Harald Bayerlein ; David Gesbert
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we model the corresponding interaction sequence as a 
Markov decision process (MDP) that is solved by deep reinforcement 
learning (DRL) algorithms to define the PCAM system's policy. Since 
modeling realistic crossing behavior of the pedestrian is challenging, 
we introduce two levels of intelligent pedestrian behavior: While the 
baseline model follows a predefined strategy, our advanced model 
captures continuous learning and the inherent uncertainty in human 
behavior by defining the pedestrian as a second DRL agent, i.e., we 
introduce a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) problem.
