HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose Swin-Unet, which is an Unet-like pure Transformer for medical image segmentation.

91, TITLE: Deep Snapshot HDR Reconstruction Based on The Polarization Camera
AUTHORS: Juiwen Ting ; Xuesong Wu ; Kangkang Hu ; Hong Zhang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we investigate the use of this sensor technology in high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging.

92, TITLE: GANs for Medical Image Synthesis: An Empirical Study
AUTHORS: Youssef Skandarani ; Pierre-Marc Jodoin ; Alain Lalande
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we perform a multi-GAN and multi-application study to gauge the benefits of GANs in medical imaging.

93, TITLE: 20-fold Accelerated 7T FMRI Using Referenceless Self-Supervised Deep Learning Reconstruction
AUTHORS: OMER BURAK DEMIREL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we utilize a self-supervised physics-guided DL reconstruction on a 5-fold SMS and 4-fold in-plane accelerated 7T fMRI data.

94, TITLE: AVA: Adversarial Vignetting Attack Against Visual Recognition
AUTHORS: BINYU TIAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Due to this natural advantage, in this work, we study vignetting from a new viewpoint, i.e., adversarial vignetting attack (AVA), which aims to embed intentionally misleading information into vignetting and produce a natural adversarial example without noise patterns.
