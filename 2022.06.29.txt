27, TITLE: Flexible Text Generation for Counterfactual Fairness Probing
AUTHORS: ZEE FRYER et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing counterfactual generation methods typically rely on wordlists or templates, producing simple counterfactuals that don't take into account grammar, context, or subtle sensitive attribute references, and could miss issues that the wordlist creators had not considered. In this paper, we introduce a task for generating counterfactuals that overcomes these shortcomings, and demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to make progress on this task.

AUTHORS: Étienne Grandjean ; Louis Jachiet
CATEGORY: cs.CC [cs.CC, cs.DS, F.1.1; F.1.3; F.2]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the RAM model itself is ill-founded in the literature, with disparate definitions and no unified results. The ambition of this paper is to found the RAM model from scratch by exhibiting a RAM model that enjoys interesting algorithmic properties and the robustness of its complexity classes, notably LIN, the class of linear-time computable problems, or the now well-known CONST-DELAY-lin class of enumeration problems computable with constant delay after linear-time preprocessing, The computation model that we define is a RAM whose contents and addresses of registers are $O(N)$, where $N$ is the size (number of registers) of the input, and where the time cost of each instruction is 1 (unit cost criterion).
