CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: This study examines the feasibility of using multitasking in three different applications, including tissue segmentation, cross-modality conversion, and bias-field correction.

263, TITLE: Covid-19 Diagnosis from X-ray Using Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Dinesh J ; Mohammed Rhithick A
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Covid-19 Diagnosis from X-ray Using Neural Networks

264, TITLE: CTSpine1K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Spinal Vertebrae Segmentation in Computed Tomography
AUTHORS: YANG DENG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated from multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT volumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal conditions.

265, TITLE: Human-level COVID-19 Diagnosis from Low-dose CT Scans Using A Two-stage Time-distributed Capsule Network
AUTHORS: PARNIAN AFSHAR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we consider low-dose and ultra-low-dose (LDCT and ULDCT) scan protocols that reduce the radiation exposure close to that of a single X-Ray, while maintaining an acceptable resolution for diagnosis purposes.

266, TITLE: BaMBNet: A Blur-aware Multi-branch Network for Defocus Deblurring
AUTHORS: Pengwei Liang ; Junjun Jiang ; Xianming Liu ; Jiayi Ma
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, this study designs a novel blur-aware multi-branch network (BaMBNet), in which different regions (with different blur amounts) should be treated differentially.

267, TITLE: Low-Dose CT Denoising Using A Structure-Preserving Kernel Prediction Network
AUTHORS: LU XU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this issue, we propose a Structure-preserving Kernel Prediction Network (StructKPN) that combines the kernel prediction network with a structure-aware loss function that utilizes the pixel gradient statistics and guides the model towards spatially-variant filters that enhance noise removal, prevent over-smoothing and preserve detailed structures for different regions in CT imaging.

268, TITLE: Hierarchical Deep Network with Uncertainty-aware Semi-supervised Learning for Vessel Segmentation
AUTHORS: CHENXIN LI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, to address the above issues, we propose a hierarchical deep network where an attention mechanism localizes the low-contrast capillary regions guided by the whole vessels, and enhance the spatial activation in those areas for the sub-type vessels.

269, TITLE: A Novel Automatic Modulation Classification Scheme Based on Multi-Scale Networks
AUTHORS: Hao Zhang ; Fuhui Zhou ; Qihui Wu ; Wei Wu ; Rose Qingyang Hu
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In order to overcome this problem, inspired by face recognition, a novel automatic modulation classification scheme is proposed by using the multi-scale network in this paper.
