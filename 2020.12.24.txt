95, TITLE: Chest X-ray Automated Triage: A Semiologic Approach Designed For Clinical Implementation, Exploiting Different Types Of Labels Through A Combination Of Four Deep Learning Architectures
AUTHORS: CANDELARIA MOSQUERA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This work presents a Deep Learning method based on the late fusion of different convolutional architectures, that allows training with heterogeneous data with a simple implementation, and evaluates its performance on independent test data. For each finding we defined the most adequate type of ground-truth label, and built four training datasets combining images from public chest x-ray datasets and our institutional archive.
