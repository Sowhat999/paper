43, TITLE:      Linguistic Analysis of Pretrained Sentence Encoders with Acceptability Judgments
http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03438
AUTHORS:        Alex Warstadt ; Samuel R. Bowman
HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce a new analysis dataset that also has broad coverage of linguistic phenomena. We annotate the development set of the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA; Warstadt et al., 2018) for the presence of 13 classes of syntactic phenomena including various forms of argument alternations, movement, and modification.

44, TITLE:      Shattered Sets and the Hilbert Function

AUTHORS:        Shay Moran ; Cyrus Rashtchian
COMMENTS:       19 pages, 2 figures. Fixed typo in Theorem 2.3
HIGHLIGHT:      We study complexity measures on subsets of the boolean hypercube and exhibit connections between algebra (the Hilbert function) and combinatorics (VC theory).

AUTHORS:        Vladimir Nekrasov ; Chunhua Shen ; Ian Reid
COMMENTS:       Updated runtime numbers on CityScapes. WACV 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In contrast, in this work we propose a novel solution able to find light-weight and accurate segmentation architectures starting from only few blocks of a pre-trained classification network.

46, TITLE:      Channel Pruning via Optimal Thresholding
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04566

COMMENTS:       9 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method, termed Optimal Thresholding (OT), to prune channels with layer dependent thresholds that optimally separate important from negligible channels.

47, TITLE:      Exploring Spatial-Temporal Multi-Frequency Analysis for High-Fidelity and Temporal-Consistency Video Prediction

COMMENTS:       Accepted by CVPR2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we point out the necessity of exploring multi-frequency analysis to deal with the two problems.

48, TITLE:      Dice: Compiling Discrete Probabilistic Programs for Scalable Inference
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09089
AUTHORS:        Steven Holtzen ; Guy Van den Broeck ; Todd Millstein
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we target scalable inference for an important class of probabilistic programs: those whose probability distributions are discrete.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03653
AUTHORS:        Alfredo Nazabal ; Pablo M. Olmos ; Zoubin Ghahramani ; Isabel Valera
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a general framework to design VAEs suitable for fitting incomplete heterogenous data.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02473
AUTHORS:        Kervy Rivas Rojas ; Gina Bustamante ; Arturo Oncevay ; Marco A. Sobrevilla Cabezudo
COMMENTS:       Accepted at ACL 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      In hierarchical text classification, we perform a sequence of inference steps to predict the category of a document from top to bottom of a given class taxonomy.

51, TITLE:      Talk to Papers: Bringing Neural Question Answering to Academic Search
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02002
AUTHORS:        Tianchang Zhao ; Kyusong Lee
COMMENTS:       demo paper accepted at ACL 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      We introduce Talk to Papers, which exploits the recent open-domain question answering (QA) techniques to improve the current experience of academic search.

AUTHORS:        Oliver Adams ; Matthew Wiesner ; Jan Trmal ; Garrett Nicolai ; David Yarowsky
COMMENTS:       To appear in SIGMORPHON 2020
HIGHLIGHT:      We investigate the problem of searching for a lexeme-set in speech by searching for its inflectional variants. We provide a recipe and evaluation set for the community to use as an extrinsic measure of the performance of inflection generation approaches.

54, TITLE:      Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Ensembles

AUTHORS:        Björn Lindenberg ; Jonas Nordqvist ; Karl-Olof Lindahl
COMMENTS:       15 pages, 2 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      Specifically, we propose an extension to categorical reinforcement learning, where distributional learning targets are implicitly based on the total information gathered by an ensemble.
