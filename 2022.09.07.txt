49, TITLE: Single-Stage Broad Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning (BMIML) with Diverse Inter-Correlations and Its Application to Medical Image Classification
AUTHORS: Qi Lai ; Jianhang Zhou ; Yanfen Gan ; Chi-Man Vong ; Deshuang Huang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing MIML methods are useful in many applications but most of which suffer from relatively low accuracy and training efficiency due to several issues: i) the inter-label correlations (i.e., the probabilistic correlations between the multiple labels corresponding to an object) are neglected; ii) the inter-instance correlations cannot be learned directly (or jointly) with other types of correlations due to the missing instance labels; iii) diverse inter-correlations (e.g., inter-label correlations, inter-instance correlations) can only be learned in multiple stages. To resolve these issues, a new single-stage framework called broad multi-instance multi-label learning (BMIML) is proposed.

In this paper, we propose two solutions to these problems: a domain discriminator to better align the local feature space between domains; and a novel pipeline that improves the back-end by spatial pyramid pooling, cross-stage partial network, region proposal network via heatmap-based region proposals, and object localization and identification through a novel image difficulty score that adapts the overall focal loss measure based on the image difficulty.

HIGHLIGHT: This results in unbalanced or incomplete datasets, requiring the use of techniques to expand them; we show how these techniques lead to biased results and misleading performance expectations. We propose a novel framework for extracting CTI from distributed data on incidents, vulnerabilities and indicators of compromise, and demonstrate its use in several practical scenarios, in conjunction with the Malware Information Sharing Platforms (MISP).

78, TITLE: To Compute or Not to Compute? Adaptive Smart Sensing in Resource-Constrained Edge Computing

104, TITLE: Cross Modal Compression: Towards Human-comprehensible Semantic Compression

HIGHLIGHT: However, with the increasing demand for machine analysis and semantic monitoring in recent years, semantic fidelity rather than signal fidelity is becoming another emerging concern in image/video compression. With the recent advances in cross modal translation and generation, in this paper, we propose the cross modal compression~(CMC), a semantic compression framework for visual data, to transform the high redundant visual data~(such as image, video, etc.) into a compact, human-comprehensible domain~(such as text, sketch, semantic map, attributions, etc.), while preserving the semantic.

105, TITLE: Domain Generalization for Prostate Segmentation in Transrectal Ultrasound Images: A Multi-center Study
AUTHORS: SULAIMAN VESAL et. al.

In this study, we address these challenges by introducing a novel 2.5D deep neural network for prostate segmentation on ultrasound images.
