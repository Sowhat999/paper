AUTHORS: QINGQING HUANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents MuLan: a first attempt at a new generation of acoustic models that link music audio directly to unconstrained natural language music descriptions.

86, TITLE: Nuclei & Glands Instance Segmentation in Histology Images: A Narrative Review
AUTHORS: Esha Sadia Nasir ; Arshi Perviaz ; Muhammad Moazam Fraz
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 68U10, I.4.9; I.5.4]
HIGHLIGHT: In this survey, 126 papers illustrating the AI based methods for nuclei and glands instance segmentation published in the last five years (2017-2022) are deeply analyzed, the limitations of current approaches and the open challenges are discussed.

87, TITLE: Using Atom-Like Local Image Features to Study Human Genetics and Neuroanatomy in Large Sets of 3D Medical Image Volumes
AUTHORS: Laurent Chauvin
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: A new algorithm is proposed to register or spatially align a pair of feature sets, entitled SIFT Coherent Point Drift (SIFT-CPD), by identifying a transform that maximizes the soft Jaccard between a fixed feature set and a transformed set.

88, TITLE: Image Reconstruction By Splitting Expectation Propagation Techniques from Iterative Inversion
AUTHORS: Robert G. Aykroyd ; Kehinde Olobatuyi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, stat.CO, stat.ME]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose an easy-to-use reconstruction method based on Expectation Propagation (EP) techniques.
