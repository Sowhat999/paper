AUTHORS:	Navid Mahmoudian Bidgoli ; Roberto G. de A. Azevedo ; Thomas Maugey ; Aline Roumy ; Pascal Frossard
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we study the learning of representation models for 
omnidirectional images and propose to use the properties of HEALPix 
uniform sampling of the sphere to redefine the mathematical tools used 
in deep learning models for omnidirectional images.

78, TITLE:	SynthSeg: Domain Randomisation for Segmentation of Brain MRI Scans of Any Contrast and Resolution
AUTHORS:	BENJAMIN BILLOT et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:	We introduce SynthSeg, the first segmentation CNN agnostic to brain MRI scans of any contrast and resolution.

79, TITLE:	Convolutional Module for Heart Localization and Segmentation in MRI
AUTHORS:	Daniel Lima ; Catharine Graves ; Marco Gutierrez ; Bruno Brandoli ; Jose Rodrigues-Jr
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, 68T07, 92C55, 92B20, I.2.10; I.4.6; I.5.1; J.3]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper we describe Visual-Motion-Focus (VMF), a module that 
detects the heart motion in the 4D MRI sequence, and highlights ROIs by 
focusing a Radial Basis Function (RBF) on the estimated motion field.

80, TITLE:	Quality and Complexity Assessment of Learning-Based Image Compression Solutions
AUTHORS:	João Dick ; Brunno Abreu ; Mateus Grellert ; Sergio Bampi
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:	This work presents an analysis of state-of-the-art learning-based image compression techniques.

81, TITLE:	DeepSMILE:
 Self-supervised Heterogeneity-aware Multiple Instance Learning for DNA 
Damage Response Defect Classification Directly from H&E Whole-slide 
Images
AUTHORS:	Yoni Schirris ; Efstratios Gavves ; Iris Nederlof ; Hugo Mark Horlings ; Jonas Teuwen
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We propose a Deep learning-based weak label learning method for 
analysing whole slide images (WSIs) of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) 
stained tumorcells not requiring pixel-level or tile-level annotations 
using Self-supervised pre-training and heterogeneity-aware deep Multiple
 Instance LEarning (DeepSMILE).

82, TITLE:	A Review of Generative Adversarial Networks in Cancer Imaging: New Applications, New Solutions
AUTHORS:	RICHARD OSUALA et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this review, we assess the potential of GANs to address a number of 
key challenges of cancer imaging, including data scarcity and imbalance,
 domain and dataset shifts, data access and privacy, data annotation and
 quantification, as well as cancer detection, tumour profiling and 
treatment planning.

83, TITLE:	Automated Segmentation and Volume Measurement of Intracranial Carotid Artery Calcification on Non-Contrast CT
AUTHORS:	GERDA BORTSOVA et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Purpose: To evaluate a fully-automated deep-learning-based method for 
assessment of intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC).

84, TITLE:	Accelerating Edge Intelligence Via Integrated Sensing and Communication
AUTHORS:	TONG ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:	This paper proposes to accelerate edge intelligence via integrated sensing and communication (ISAC).
