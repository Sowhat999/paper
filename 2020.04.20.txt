COMMENTS:       28 pages, 14 figures
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose a new reputation-based ranking system, utilizing multipartite rating subnetworks, which clusters users by their similarities using three measures, two of them based on Kolmogorov complexity.

AUTHORS:        Joe Stacey ; Pasquale Minervini ; Haim Dubossarsky ; Sebastian Riedel ; Tim Rocktäschel
COMMENTS:       8 pages

COMMENTS:       6 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, WIP
HIGHLIGHT:      In this work, we formulate the NER task as a multi-answer question answering (MAQA) task and provide different knowledge contexts, such as entity types, questions, definitions and definitions with examples.

AUTHORS:        Shijie Ai ; Lili Pan ; Yazhou Ren
COMMENTS:       7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables

54, TITLE:      Butterfly Transform: An Efficient FFT Based Neural Architecture Design
http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02256
AUTHORS:        Keivan Alizadeh Vahid ; Anish Prabhu ; Ali Farhadi ; Mohammad Rastegari
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we show that extending the butterfly operations from the FFT algorithm to a general Butterfly Transform (BFT) can be beneficial in building an efficient block structure for CNN designs. We introduce a set of criteria for channel fusion and prove that BFT yields an asymptotically optimal FLOP count with respect to these criteria.
