123, TITLE: Disentangled Contrastive Collaborative Filtering
AUTHORS: Xubin Ren ; Lianghao Xia ; Jiashu Zhao ; Dawei Yin ; Chao Huang
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While many of them show their effectiveness, two key questions still remain unexplored: i) Most existing GCL-based CF models are still limited by ignoring the fact that user-item interaction behaviors are often driven by diverse latent intent factors (e.g., shopping for family party, preferred color or brand of products); ii) Their introduced non-adaptive augmentation techniques are vulnerable to noisy information, which raises concerns about the model's robustness and the risk of incorporating misleading self-supervised signals. In light of these limitations, we propose a Disentangled Contrastive Collaborative Filtering framework (DCCF) to realize intent disentanglement with self-supervised augmentation in an adaptive fashion.

160, TITLE: Improving Code Example Recommendations on Informal Documentation Using BERT and Query-Aware LSH: A Comparative Study
AUTHORS: Sajjad Rahmani ; AmirHossein Naghshzan ; Latifa Guerrouj
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We have utilized BERT in our approach, which is a Large Language Model (LLM) for text representation that can effectively extract semantic information from textual data.

161, TITLE: Weighted Tallying Bandits: Overcoming Intractability Via Repeated Exposure Optimality
AUTHORS: Dhruv Malik ; Conor Igoe ; Yuanzhi Li ; Aarti Singh
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Motivated by this, a significant line of work has formalized settings where an action's loss is a function of the number of times that action was recently played in the prior $m$ timesteps, where $m$ corresponds to a bound on human memory capacity. To more faithfully capture decay of human memory with time, we introduce the Weighted Tallying Bandit (WTB), which generalizes this setting by requiring that an action's loss is a function of a \emph{weighted} summation of the number of times that arm was played in the last $m$ timesteps.

162, TITLE: Neuralizer: General Neuroimage Analysis Without Re-Training
AUTHORS: Steffen Czolbe ; Adrian V. Dalca
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce Neuralizer, a single model that generalizes to previously unseen neuroimaging tasks and modalities without the need for re-training or fine-tuning.

163, TITLE: Synthetic DOmain-Targeted Augmentation (S-DOTA) Improves Model Generalization in Digital Pathology
AUTHORS: SAI CHOWDARY GULLAPALLY et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, generalization of these tools is currently limited by sensitivity to variations in tissue preparation, staining procedures and scanning equipment that lead to domain shift in digitized slides. To overcome this limitation and improve model generalization, we studied the effectiveness of two Synthetic DOmain-Targeted Augmentation (S-DOTA) methods, namely CycleGAN-enabled Scanner Transform (ST) and targeted Stain Vector Augmentation (SVA), and compared them against the International Color Consortium (ICC) profile-based color calibration (ICC Cal) method and a baseline method using traditional brightness, color and noise augmentations.

164, TITLE: Expanding Synthetic Real-World Degradations for Blind Video Super Resolution
AUTHORS: Mehran Jeelani ; Noshaba Cheema ; Klaus Illgner-Fehns ; Philipp Slusallek ; Sunil Jaiswal
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Since obtaining a synthetic dataset consisting of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) frames are easier than obtaining real-world LR and HR images, in this paper, we propose synthesizing real-world degradations on synthetic training datasets.

165, TITLE: Self-Supervised Learning for Organs At Risk and Tumor Segmentation with Uncertainty Quantification
AUTHORS: ILKIN ISLER et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, our goal is to show the impact of self-supervised pre-training of transformers for organ at risk (OAR) and tumor segmentation as compared to costly fully-supervised learning.

166, TITLE: Comparison of Different Retinal Regions-of-interest Imaged By OCT for The Classification of Intermediate AMD
AUTHORS: DANILO A. JESUS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: A total of 15744 B-scans from 269 intermediate AMD patients and 115 normal subjects were used in this study (split on subject level in 80% train, 10% validation and 10% test).

167, TITLE: GAMIVAL: Video Quality Prediction on Mobile Cloud Gaming Content
AUTHORS: YU-CHIH CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.MM, 68U10]
HIGHLIGHT: We have created a new gaming-specific NR VQA model called the Gaming Video Quality Evaluator (GAMIVAL), which combines and leverages the advantages of spatial and temporal gaming distorted scene statistics models, a neural noise model, and deep semantic features.

168, TITLE: Meta-Learning Enabled Score-Based Generative Model for 1.5T-Like Image Reconstruction from 0.5T MRI
AUTHORS: ZHUO-XU CUI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We theoretically uncovered that the combination of these challenges renders conventional deep learning methods that directly learn the mapping from a low-field MR image to a high-field MR image unsuitable. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel meta-learning approach that employs a teacher-student mechanism.

169, TITLE: Spatial and Modal Optimal Transport for Fast Cross-Modal MRI Reconstruction
AUTHORS: QI WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: On the other hand, the T1-weighted image (T1WI) shares the same underlying information with T2-weighted image (T2WI), which needs a shorter scanning time. Therefore, in this paper we accelerate the acquisition of the T2WI by introducing the auxiliary modality (T1WI).

170, TITLE: Point Transformer For Coronary Artery Labeling
AUTHORS: Xu Wang ; Jun Ma ; Jing Li
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a simple vessel labeling method based on the Point Transformer, which only needs the coronary artery segmentation.

171, TITLE: Using Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stream Network with Self-Supervised Learning for Lung Tumor Classification on Radial Probe Endobronchial Ultrasound Video
AUTHORS: Ching-Kai Lin ; Chin-Wen Chen ; Yun-Chien Cheng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system for classifying benign and malignant lung lesions, and to assist physicians in real-time analysis of radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) videos.

172, TITLE: Semantically Structured Image Compression Via Irregular Group-Based Decoupling
AUTHORS: Ruoyu Feng ; Yixin Gao ; Xin Jin ; Runsen Feng ; Zhibo Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Nevertheless, they divide the input image into multiple rectangular regions according to semantics and ignore avoiding information interaction among them, causing waste of bitrate and distorted reconstruction of region boundaries. In this paper, we propose to decouple an image into multiple groups with irregular shapes based on a customized group mask and compress them independently.
