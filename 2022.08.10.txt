27, TITLE: Sports Video Analysis on Large-Scale Data
AUTHORS: Dekun Wu ; He Zhao ; Xingce Bao ; Richard P. Wildes
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: There are several major reasons: (1) The used dataset is collected from non-official providers, which naturally creates a gap between models trained on those datasets and real-world applications; (2) previously proposed methods require extensive annotation efforts (i.e., player and ball segmentation at pixel level) on localizing useful visual features to yield acceptable results; (3) very few public datasets are available. In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale NBA dataset for Sports Video Analysis (NSVA) with a focus on captioning, to address the above challenges.

40, TITLE: Long-term Causal Effects Estimation Via Latent Surrogates Representation Learning
AUTHORS: RUICHU CAI et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: However, such methods cannot be well applied to real-world scenarios, in which the partially observed surrogates are mixed with their proxies among short-term outcomes. To this end, we develop our flexible method, Laser, to estimate long-term causal effects in the more realistic situation that the surrogates are observed or have observed proxies.Given the indistinguishability between the surrogates and proxies, we utilize identifiable variational auto-encoder (iVAE) to recover the whole valid surrogates on all the surrogates candidates without the need of distinguishing the observed surrogates or the proxies of latent surrogates.
