261, TITLE: Differentiable Microscopy for Content and Task Aware Compressive Fluorescence Imaging
AUTHORS: Udith Haputhanthri ; Andrew Seeber ; Dushan Wadduwage
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.optics, q-bio.QM, I.2.6; I.4.1; I.4.2; I.4.3; I.4.5; I.4.6; I.4.7; I.5.1; I.5.2; J.2; J.3; I.5.5]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose differentiable compressive fluorescence microscopy ($\partial \mu$) which includes a realistic generalizable forward model with learnable-physical parameters (e.g. illumination patterns), and a novel physics-inspired inverse model.
