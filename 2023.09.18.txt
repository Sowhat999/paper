HIGHLIGHT: For a fixed finite set of finite tournaments ${\mathcal F}$, the ${\mathcal F}$-free orientation problem asks whether a given finite undirected graph $G$ has an $\mathcal F$-free orientation, i.e., whether the edges of $G$ can be oriented so that the resulting digraph does not embed any of the tournaments from ${\mathcal F}$. We prove that for every ${\mathcal F}$, this problem is in P or NP-complete.
