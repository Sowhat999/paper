40, TITLE: Detecting Localized Adversarial Examples: A Generic Approach Using Critical Region Analysis
AUTHORS: FENGTING LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied in a wide range of applications,e.g.,face recognition and image classification;however,they are vulnerable to adversarial examples.By adding a small amount of imperceptible perturbations,an attacker can easily manipulate the outputs of a DNN.Particularly,the localized adversarial examples only perturb a small and contiguous region of the target object,so that they are robust and effective in both digital and physical worlds.Although the localized adversarial examples have more severe real-world impacts than traditional pixel attacks,they have not been well addressed in the literature.In this paper,we propose a generic defense system called TaintRadar to accurately detect localized adversarial examples via analyzing critical regions that have been manipulated by attackers.The main idea is that when removing critical regions from input images,the ranking changes of adversarial labels will be larger than those of benign labels.Compared with existing defense solutions,TaintRadar can effectively capture sophisticated localized partial attacks, e.g.,the eye-glasses attack,while not requiring additional training or fine-tuning of the original model's structure.Comprehensive experiments have been conducted in both digital and physical worlds to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our defense.

HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose an Ising energy model within an optimization framework for pruning convolutional kernels and hidden units.

86, TITLE: NOELLE Offers Empowering LLVM Extensions
AUTHORS: ANGELO MATNI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces NOELLE, a robust open-source domain-independent compilation layer built upon LLVM providing this support.

87, TITLE: DARE-SLAM: Degeneracy-Aware and Resilient Loop Closing in Perceptually-Degraded Environments
AUTHORS: Kamak Ebadi ; Matteo Palieri ; Sally Wood ; Curtis Padgett ; Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a degeneracy-aware and drift-resilient loop closing method to improve place recognition and resolve 3D location ambiguities for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in GPS-denied, large-scale and perceptually-degraded environments.

88, TITLE: On FGLM Algorithms with Tate Algebras
AUTHORS: Xavier Caruso ; Tristan Vaccon ; Thibaut Verron
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC]
HIGHLIGHT: In the present article, we extend the FGLM algorithm of [FGLM93] to Tate algebras.

91, TITLE: Learning to Enhance Visual Quality Via Hyperspectral Domain Mapping
AUTHORS: Harsh Sinha ; Aditya Mehta ; Murari Mandal ; Pratik Narang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]

92, TITLE: Reference-based Texture Transfer for Single Image Super-resolution of Magnetic Resonance Images
AUTHORS: Madhu Mithra K K ; Sriprabha Ramanarayanan ; Keerthi Ram ; Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Building upon state-of-the-art single image super-resolution, we propose a reference-based, unpaired multi-contrast texture-transfer strategy for deep learning based in-plane and across-plane MRI super-resolution.

93, TITLE: D2A U-Net: Automatic Segmentation of COVID-19 Lesions from CT Slices with Dilated Convolution and Dual Attention Mechanism
AUTHORS: XIANGYU ZHAO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we propose a dilated dual attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT slices based on dilated convolution and a novel dual attention mechanism to address the issues above.
