Therefore, in this paper, we treat the point clouds as moving camera videos and explore the way of dealing with PCQA tasks via using video quality assessment (VQA) methods in a no-reference (NR) manner.

CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose FUSION, a new method for promoting stain-adaption by adjusting the model to the target in an unsupervised test-time scenario, eliminating the necessity for significant labelling at the target end.

86, TITLE: On The Automated Segmentation of Epicardial and Mediastinal Cardiac Adipose Tissues Using Classification Algorithms
AUTHORS: Érick Oliveira Rodrigues ; Felipe Fernandes Cordeiro de Morais ; Aura Conci
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This work proposes a novel technique for the automatic segmentation of cardiac fat pads.

87, TITLE: Learned Lossless Image Compression With Combined Autoregressive Models And Attention Modules
AUTHORS: Ran Wang ; Jinming Liu ; Heming Sun ; Jiro Katto
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, there are still many impressive lossy compression methods that can be applied to lossless compression. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the methods widely used in lossy compression and apply them to lossless compression.

88, TITLE: Stabilize, Decompose, and Denoise: Self-Supervised Fluoroscopy Denoising
AUTHORS: RUIZHOU LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Such denoising is challenged by the relative motion between the object being imaged and the X-ray imaging system. We tackle this challenge by proposing a self-supervised, three-stage framework that exploits the domain knowledge of fluoroscopy imaging.

89, TITLE: Airway Measurement By Refinement of Synthetic Images Improves Mortality Prediction in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
AUTHORS: ASHKAN PAKZAD et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose synthesising airways by style transfer using perceptual losses to train our model, Airway Transfer Network (ATN).

90, TITLE: Automated Recognition of The Pericardium Contour on Processed CT Images Using Genetic Algorithms
AUTHORS: E. O. Rodrigues ; L. O. Rodrigues ; L. S. N. Oliveira ; A. Conci ; P. Liatsis
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: This work proposes the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in tracing and recognizing the pericardium contour of the human heart using Computed Tomography (CT) images.

91, TITLE: SB-SSL: Slice-Based Self-Supervised Transformers for Knee Abnormality Classification from MRI
AUTHORS: Sara Atito ; Syed Muhammad Anwar ; Muhammad Awais ; Josef Kitler
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Herein, we propose a slice-based self-supervised deep learning framework (SB-SSL), a novel slice-based paradigm for classifying abnormality using knee MRI scans.

92, TITLE: FAST-AID Brain: Fast and Accurate Segmentation Tool Using Artificial Intelligence Developed for Brain
AUTHORS: Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi ; Mads Nielsen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: A novel deep learning method is proposed for fast and accurate segmentation of the human brain into 132 regions.

93, TITLE: Representation Learning Based and Interpretable Reactor System Diagnosis Using Denoising Padded Autoencoder
AUTHORS: Chengyuan Li ; Zhifang Qiu ; Zhangrui Yan ; Meifu Li
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: To overcome the common problems of previous work in diagnosing reactor accidents using deep learning theory, this paper proposes a diagnostic process that ensures robustness to noisy and crippled data and is interpretable.
