AUTHORS: Shahaf Bassan ; Guy Amir ; Davide Corsi ; Idan Refaeli ; Guy Katz
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.LO]

Here, we begin bridging this gap, and propose a formal DNN-verification-based XAI technique for reasoning about multi-step, reactive systems.

AUTHORS: Christina Niklaus ; Matthias Cetto ; André Freitas ; Siegfried Handschuh
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: State-of-the-art syntactic TS approaches suffer from two major drawbacks: first, they follow a very conservative approach in that they tend to retain the input rather than transforming it, and second, they ignore the cohesive nature of texts, where context spread across clauses or sentences is needed to infer the true meaning of a statement. To address these problems, we present a discourse-aware TS approach that splits and rephrases complex English sentences within the semantic context in which they occur.
