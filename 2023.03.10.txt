AUTHORS: Zhonghua Wu ; Yicheng Wu ; Guosheng Lin ; Jianfei Cai
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We observe that the straightforward way of applying consistency constraints to weakly-supervised point cloud segmentation has two major limitations: noisy pseudo labels due to the conventional confidence-based selection and insufficient consistency constraints due to discarding unreliable pseudo labels. Therefore, we propose a novel Reliability-Adaptive Consistency Network (RAC-Net) to use both prediction confidence and model uncertainty to measure the reliability of pseudo labels and apply consistency training on all unlabeled points while with different consistency constraints for different points based on the reliability of corresponding pseudo labels.

HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods primarily utilize information acquired from a single dimensionality (2D/3D), resulting in sub-optimal performance on challenging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with multiple objects and highly anisotropic resolution. To address this issue, we present a Hybrid Dual Mean-Teacher (HD-Teacher) model with hybrid, semi-supervised, and multi-task learning to achieve highly effective semi-supervised segmentation.

HIGHLIGHT: Here, we introduce a neural network model that can predict many complex IAPs used to generate an MR image with high accuracy solely using the image, with a single forward pass.
