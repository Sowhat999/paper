AUTHORS:        Robin Tibor Schirrmeister ; Yuxuan Zhou ; Tonio Ball ; Dan Zhang
HIGHLIGHT:      To remove the negative impact of model bias and domain prior on detecting high-level differences, we propose two methods, first, using the log likelihood ratios of two identical models, one trained on the in-distribution data (e.g., CIFAR10) and the other one on a more general distribution of images (e.g., 80 Million Tiny Images).

COMMENTS:       76 pages
HIGHLIGHT:      We prove that there is no Maltsev condition that characterizes Datalog already for the CSPs of first-order reducts of (Q;<); such CSPs are called temporal CSPs and are of fundamental importance in infinite-domain constraint satisfaction.

AUTHORS:        Gong Cheng ; Xingxing Xie ; Junwei Han ; Lei Guo ; Gui-Song Xia
COMMENTS:       This manuscript is the accepted version for IEEE JSTARS
HIGHLIGHT:      To be specific, we discuss the main challenges of remote sensing image scene classification and survey (1) Autoencoder-based remote sensing image scene classification methods, (2) Convolutional Neural Network-based remote sensing image scene classification methods, and (3) Generative Adversarial Network-based remote sensing image scene classification methods. In addition, we introduce the benchmarks used for remote sensing image scene classification and summarize the performance of more than two dozen of representative algorithms on three commonly-used benchmark data sets.
