In this work, we use these real-world LQ face images and their restored HQ counterparts to model the complex real degradation (namely ReDegNet), and then transfer it to HQ natural images to synthesize their realistic LQ ones.

48, TITLE: Heatmap Distribution Matching for Human Pose Estimation
AUTHORS: Haoxuan Qu ; Li Xu ; Yujun Cai ; Lin Geng Foo ; Jun Liu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For tackling the task of 2D human pose estimation, the great majority of the recent methods regard this task as a heatmap estimation problem, and optimize the heatmap prediction using the Gaussian-smoothed heatmap as the optimization objective and using the pixel-wise loss (e.g. MSE) as the loss function. In this paper, we show that optimizing the heatmap prediction in such a way, the model performance of body joint localization, which is the intrinsic objective of this task, may not be consistently improved during the optimization process of the heatmap prediction.

51, TITLE: Smooth Image-to-image Translations with Latent Space Interpolations
AUTHORS: YAHUI LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, state-of-the-art methods usually perform poorly when evaluated using inter-domain interpolations, often producing abrupt changes in the appearance or non-realistic intermediate images. In this paper, we argue that one of the main reasons behind this problem is the lack of sufficient inter-domain training data and we propose two different regularization methods to alleviate this issue: a new shrinkage loss, which compacts the latent space, and a Mixup data-augmentation strategy, which flattens the style representations between domains.

In the present study, therefore, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the shape of the target object using minimal data.
