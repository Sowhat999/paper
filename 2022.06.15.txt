For such Markov chains, we give a quantization method which requires an ancilla register of dimension equal to only the number of different energy values, which is often significantly smaller than the size of the state space.

9, TITLE: Memory-Based Model Editing at Scale
AUTHORS: Eric Mitchell ; Charles Lin ; Antoine Bosselut ; Christopher D. Manning ; Chelsea Finn
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing model editors have shown promise, but also suffer from insufficient expressiveness: they struggle to accurately model an edit's intended scope (examples affected by the edit), leading to inaccurate predictions for test inputs loosely related to the edit, and they often fail altogether after many edits. As a higher-capacity alternative, we propose Semi-Parametric Editing with a Retrieval-Augmented Counterfactual Model (SERAC), which stores edits in an explicit memory and learns to reason over them to modulate the base model's predictions as needed.

To this end, we propose a novel method Online Easy Example Mining (OEEM) that encourages the network to focus on credible supervision signals rather than noisy signals, therefore mitigating the influence of inevitable false predictions in pseudo-masks.

83, TITLE: Counting Markov Equivalent Directed Acyclic Graphs Consistent with Background Knowledge
AUTHORS: Vidya Sagar Sharma

In this paper, we consider the more general problem of counting the number of directed acyclic graphs in a Markov equivalence class when the directions of some of the edges are also fixed (this setting arises, for example, when interventional data is partially available).
