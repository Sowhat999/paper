AUTHORS: Vedang Lad ; Jonas Mueller
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The labor-intensive annotation process of semantic segmentation datasets is often prone to errors, since humans struggle to label every pixel correctly. We study algorithms to automatically detect such annotation errors, in particular methods to score label quality, such that the images with the lowest scores are least likely to be correctly labeled.

96, TITLE: Domain-Agnostic Neural Architecture for Class Incremental Continual Learning in Document Processing Platform
AUTHORS: Mateusz Wójcik ; Witold Ko?ciukiewicz ; Mateusz Baran ; Tomasz Kajdanowicz ; Adam Gonczarek
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent methods with stochastic gradient learning have been shown to struggle in such setups or have limitations like memory buffers, and being restricted to specific domains that disable its usage in real-world scenarios. For this reason, we present a fully differentiable architecture based on the Mixture of Experts model, that enables the training of high-performance classifiers when examples from each class are presented separately.

97, TITLE: Score Function Gradient Estimation to Widen The Applicability of Decision-Focused Learning
AUTHORS: MATTIA SILVESTRI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, state-of-the-art DFL methods are limited by the assumptions they make about the structure of the optimization problem (e.g., that the problem is linear) and by the fact that can only predict parameters that appear in the objective function. In this work, we address these limitations by instead predicting \textit{distributions} over parameters and adopting score function gradient estimation (SFGE) to compute decision-focused updates to the predictive model, thereby widening the applicability of DFL.

We explore how reference immutability interacts with features commonly found in these hybrid languages, in particular with higher-order functions -- polymorphism -- and subtyping.

AUTHORS: Jack Jewson ; Sahra Ghalebikesabi ; Chris Holmes
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: The application of current approaches has, however, been limited by their strong bounding assumptions which do not hold for basic models, such as simple linear regressors. To ameliorate this, we propose $\beta$D-Bayes, a posterior sampling scheme from a generalised posterior targeting the minimisation of the $\beta$-divergence between the model and the data generating process.

AUTHORS: ZHIWEN YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the generalist model can suffer from the center interference issue, \textit{i.e.} the gradient directions of different centers can be inconsistent or even opposite owing to the non-identical data distribution. To mitigate such interference, we introduce a novel dynamic routing strategy with cross-layer connections that routes data from different centers to different experts.

To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised SVCT reconstruction method -- Anti-Aliasing Projection Representation Field (APRF), which can build the continuous representation between adjacent projection views via the spatial constraints.
