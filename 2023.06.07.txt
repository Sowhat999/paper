To show the validity of the proposed metric, we build up a large-scale benchmark with various degrees of semantic similarities between labeled/unlabeled datasets on ImageNet by leveraging its hierarchical class structure.

164, TITLE: Inductive Bias for Emergent Communication in A Continuous Setting
AUTHORS: John Isak Fjellvang Villanger ; Troels Arnfred Bojesen
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.MA, I.2.11]
HIGHLIGHT: The communication channel may consist of either discrete symbols or continuous variables. We introduce an inductive bias to aid with the emergence of good communication protocols for continuous messages, and we look at the effect this type of inductive bias has for continuous and discrete messages in itself or when used in combination with reinforcement learning.

AUTHORS: Shubham Gupta ; Sahil Manchanda ; Sayan Ranu ; Srikanta Bedathur
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these techniques (i) assume uniformity of feature set across nodes, (ii) are transductive by nature, and (iii) fail to work when features are added or removed over time. In this work, we address these limitations through a novel GNN framework called GRAFENNE.

169, TITLE: Survival Instinct in Offline Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Anqi Li ; Dipendra Misra ; Andrey Kolobov ; Ching-An Cheng
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: As we prove in this work, pessimism endows the agent with a "survival instinct", i.e., an incentive to stay within the data support in the long term, while the limited and biased data coverage further constrains the set of survival policies.

170, TITLE: LEACE: Perfect Linear Concept Erasure in Closed Form
AUTHORS: NORA BELROSE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce LEAst-squares Concept Erasure (LEACE), a closed-form method which provably prevents all linear classifiers from detecting a concept while inflicting the least possible damage to the representation.

AUTHORS: SHIKUN LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SI]
HIGHLIGHT: This work examines different impacts of distribution shifts caused by either graph structure or node attributes and identifies a new type of shift, named conditional structure shift (CSS), which current GDA approaches are provably sub-optimal to deal with. A novel approach, called structural reweighting (StruRW), is proposed to address this issue and is tested on synthetic graphs, four benchmark datasets, and a new application in HEP.

176, TITLE: Computation with Sequences in The Brain
AUTHORS: Max Dabagia ; Christos H. Papadimitriou ; Santosh S. Vempala
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-bio.NC]
HIGHLIGHT: A simple formal model of neural activity was proposed in Papadimitriou [2020] and has been subsequently shown, through both mathematical proofs and simulations, to be capable of implementing certain simple cognitive operations via the creation and manipulation of assemblies of neurons.

178, TITLE: Spike-based Computation Using Classical Recurrent Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Florent De Geeter ; Damien Ernst ; Guillaume Drion
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.LG]

179, TITLE: Generating Private Synthetic Data with Genetic Algorithms
AUTHORS: Terrance Liu ; Jingwu Tang ; Giuseppe Vietri ; Zhiwei Steven Wu
CATEGORY: cs.OH [cs.OH, cs.CR, cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: However, even when possible, these approaches impose a fundamental limitation in which modifications to the minimization problem become additional sources of error. Therefore, we propose Private-GSD, a private genetic algorithm based on zeroth-order optimization heuristics that do not require modifying the original objective.

180, TITLE: Exploring The Effects of Robotic Design on Learning and Neural Control
AUTHORS: Joshua Paul Powers
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Most work in this field is focused on the development of more sophisticated learning algorithms for a robot's controller given a largely static and presupposed robotic design. By focusing on the development of robotic bodies, rather than neural controllers, I have discovered that robots can be designed such that they overcome many of the current pitfalls encountered by neural controllers in multitask settings.

181, TITLE: Simulation-Based Counterfactual Causal Discovery on Real World Driver Behaviour
AUTHORS: Rhys Howard ; Lars Kunze
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, I.2.9; I.2.6; I.6.0]
HIGHLIGHT: To counter the issue of non-stationarity we reformulate the problem in terms of extracted events, while the previously mentioned restriction upon interventions can be overcome with the use of counterfactual simulation. We present three variants of the proposed counterfactual causal discovery method and evaluate these against state of the art observational temporal causal discovery methods across 3396 causal scenes extracted from a real world driving dataset.

AUTHORS: Faris Janjo? ; Max Keller ; Maxim Dolgov ; J. Marius Zöllner
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, I.1.2]

This work presents TestLab, an intelligent automated software testing framework that attempts to gather a set of testing methods and automate them using Artificial Intelligence to allow continuous testing of software systems at multiple levels from different scopes, ranging from developers to end-users.

189, TITLE: Benchmarking Robustness of AI-enabled Multi-sensor Fusion Systems: Challenges and Opportunities
AUTHORS: XINYU GAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Given that many intelligent systems such as self-driving cars are operated in safety-critical contexts where perception systems play an important role, there comes an urgent need for a more in-depth understanding of the performance and reliability of these MSF systems. To bridge this gap, we initiate an early step in this direction and construct a public benchmark of AI-enabled MSF-based perception systems including three commonly adopted tasks (i.e., object detection, object tracking, and depth completion).

190, TITLE: DeepVQE: Real Time Deep Voice Quality Enhancement for Joint Acoustic Echo Cancellation, Noise Suppression and Dereverberation

We conduct several ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components of our model to the overall performance.

HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we consider the problem of deciding the existence of real solutions to a system of polynomial equations having real coefficients, and which are invariant under the action of the symmetric group.

192, TITLE: L-C2ST: Local Diagnostics for Posterior Approximations in Simulation-Based Inference
AUTHORS: Julia Linhart ; Alexandre Gramfort ; Pedro L. C. Rodrigues
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-bio.NC]

193, TITLE: Mega-TTS: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech at Scale with Intrinsic Inductive Bias
AUTHORS: ZIYUE JIANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: However, previous works usually encode speech into latent using audio codec and use autoregressive language models or diffusion models to generate it, which ignores the intrinsic nature of speech and may lead to inferior or uncontrollable results. We argue that speech can be decomposed into several attributes (e.g., content, timbre, prosody, and phase) and each of them should be modeled using a module with appropriate inductive biases.

194, TITLE: Modality-Agnostic Learning for Medical Image Segmentation Using Multi-modality Self-distillation

196, TITLE: CiT-Net: Convolutional Neural Networks Hand in Hand with Vision Transformers for Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: TAO LEI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Second, although a Transformer branch can capture the global features, it ignores the channel and cross-dimensional self-attention, resulting in a low segmentation accuracy on complex-content images. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid architecture of convolutional neural networks hand in hand with vision Transformers (CiT-Net) for medical image segmentation.
