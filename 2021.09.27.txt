engineered filtering, a training and data-mixing methodology, and a 
sensor hardware design.

78, TITLE:	SIM2REALVIZ: Visualizing The Sim2Real Gap in Robot Ego-Pose Estimation
AUTHORS:	Theo Jaunet ; Guillaume Bono ; Romain Vuillemot ; Christian Wolf
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.HC, cs.LG]

assist experts in understanding and reducing this gap for robot ego-pose
 estimation tasks, i.e. the estimation of a robot's position using 
trained models.

AUTHORS:	Giorgia Adorni ; Elia Cereda
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this project we trained a neural network to perform specific 
interactions between a robot and objects in the environment, through 
imitation learning.

HIGHLIGHT:
	In this study, a statistical analysis comparison protocol was applied 
to a set of 3D topological images of fractured surface pairs and their 
replicas to provide confidence in the quantitative statistical 
comparison between fractured items and their replicas.

88, TITLE:	Few-shot Learning Based on Multi-stage Transfer and Class-Balanced Loss for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading
AUTHORS:	Lei Shi ; Junxing Zhang
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we introduce the idea of multi-stage transfer into the 
grading task of DR. The new transfer learning technique leverages 
multiple datasets with differ-ent scales to enable the model to learn 
more feature representation information.
