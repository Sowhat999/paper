CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.LO]
HIGHLIGHT: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in exploiting logically specified background knowledge in order to obtain neural models (i) with a better performance, (ii) able to learn from less data, and/or (iii) guaranteed to be compliant with the background knowledge itself, e.g., for safety-critical applications.

15, TITLE: A Human-Centric Perspective on Fairness and Transparency in Algorithmic Decision-Making
AUTHORS: Jakob Schoeffer
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This is not only problematic from a legal perspective, but non-transparent systems are also prone to yield unfair outcomes because their sanity is challenging to assess and calibrate in the first place -- which is particularly worrisome for human decision-subjects. Based on this observation and building upon existing work, I aim to make the following three main contributions through my doctoral thesis: (a) understand how (potential) decision-subjects perceive algorithmic decisions (with varying degrees of transparency of the underlying ADS), as compared to similar decisions made by humans; (b) evaluate different tools for transparent decision-making with respect to their effectiveness in enabling people to appropriately assess the quality and fairness of ADS; and (c) develop human-understandable technical artifacts for fair automated decision-making.

For this, we introduce an analytic model of the statistics learned by seminal algorithms (including GloVe and Word2Vec), and derive insights for systems that use these algorithms and the statistics of co-occurrence, in general.

AUTHORS: Yang Zhou ; Wee Sun Lee
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This ignores the context of entity pairs and the label correlations between the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to sub-optimal predictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label loss that encourages large \textit{margins} of label confidence scores between each pre-defined class and the none class, which enables captured label correlations and context-dependent thresholding for label prediction.

AUTHORS: Mihir Parmar ; Swaroop Mishra ; Mor Geva ; Chitta Baral
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: These benchmarks are typically collected by crowdsourcing, where annotators write examples based on annotation instructions crafted by dataset creators. In this work, we hypothesize that annotators pick up on patterns in the crowdsourcing instructions, which bias them to write similar examples that are then over-represented in the collected data.

36, TITLE: Quality-Aware Decoding for Neural Machine Translation
AUTHORS: PATRICK FERNANDES et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the progress in machine translation quality estimation and evaluation in the last years, decoding in neural machine translation (NMT) is mostly oblivious to this and centers around finding the most probable translation according to the model (MAP decoding), approximated with beam search. In this paper, we bring together these two lines of research and propose quality-aware decoding for NMT, by leveraging recent breakthroughs in reference-free and reference-based MT evaluation through various inference methods like $N$-best reranking and minimum Bayes risk decoding.

AUTHORS: Pragaash Ponnusamy ; Clint Solomon Mathialagan ; Gustavo Aguilar ; Chengyuan Ma ; Chenlei Guo
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, such learning, particularly in Markov-based query rewriting systems have far from addressed the impact of these models on future training where successive feedback is inevitably contingent on the rewrite itself, especially in a continually updating environment. In this paper, we explore the consequences of this inherent lack of self-awareness towards impairing the model performance, ultimately resulting in both Type I and II errors over time.

51, TITLE: ELQA: A Corpus of Questions and Answers About The English Language

60, TITLE: A New Evaluation Method: Evaluation Data and Metrics for Chinese Grammar Error Correction
AUTHORS: Nankai Lin ; Nankai Lin ; Xiaotian Lin ; Ziyu Yang ; Shengyi Jiang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it is expected that these metrics should be independent of the word segmentation results and language models, as they may lead to a lack of uniqueness and comparability in the evaluation of different methods. To this end, we propose three novel evaluation metrics for CGEC in two dimensions: reference-based and reference-less.

61, TITLE: Exposing Cross-Lingual Lexical Knowledge from Multilingual Sentence Encoders

AUTHORS: Felix Stahlberg ; Shankar Kumar

AUTHORS: Kun Zhou ; Beichen Zhang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Ji-Rong Wen
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Such a way may cause the sampling bias that improper negatives (e.g. false negatives and anisotropy representations) are used to learn sentence representations, which will hurt the uniformity of the representation space.
